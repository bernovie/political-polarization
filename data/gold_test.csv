The Cuban Government is consciously moving closer to the Soviet Union to demonstrate its in , dependence of the United States . This seems to be the opinion of most well-informed diplomats here the day after Cuba 's sign ; ing of a commercial and political agreement with First Deputy Premier Anastas I. Mikoyan of the Soviet Union . Some members of the diplomatic corps place a more extreme interpretation on the trend of events . They believe Premier Fidel Castro is moving left not only as a tactic to balance the economic influence of Washington but for ideological reasons . Even those diplomats who think Dr. Castro is merely trying to get everything he can from both Washington and Moscow agree that Communist influence is growing in Havana and might even get beyond the Premier 's control . The Mikoyan-Castro agree-ment provides a twelve-year ( credit of 5100,000,000 at 2  tons of sugar for dollars over a five.","year period .

"" Even before the announce // ment it had been noted here that Dr. Castro was bringing in non-Cuban experts , some of them with extreme Leftist if not Communist backgrounds , to help him organize his . Government . This trend is expected to increase as a result of the agreement , under which the Soviet Union will provide experts to maintain the machinery if requested .

"" This was interpreted by diplomats here as meaning that Cuba was likely to work with the Soviet and Asian-African blocs in the United Nations  often support , is gradually losing its majority in the General Assembly . Cuban- officials denied today that the agreement was anything more than the kind of commercial arrangement made by the United States with Communist Poland . They repeated Dr. Castro 's familiar theme that Cuba wanted to be independent of both capitalism and communism . Communism , they said , quoting Dr. Castro , is a form of social organization that "" gives you food without liberty , "" while capitalism "" gives you liberty and starves you to death . "" Cuba , they insisted , is building a system of organized "" humanism , "" which they defined as "" bread without fear and liberty without terror . "" What seems to impress objective observers of the Cuban revolution , however , is not so much the emotional rhetoric of officials as the disorganization of the Government in dealing with practical economic problems . Present State of Nation Thirteen months after Dr. Castro established his Government , there seems to be general agreement in the diplomatic corps on these points : 9The Premier is rapidly breaking up  government that in many ways resembles national socialism even more than communism . ciHe has lost considerable support among the professional , middle and intellectual classes that supported his revolution , but still has great support among the workers and peasants and is the only symbol of authority in Cuba .","He has proved to be better at destroying power than at building a constructive and well-organized Government . His revolution is going through that difficult and "" even dangerous transition between the tearing down and the building up , and he is tearing down faster than he is building  --  though there is evidence of considerable construction of houses and schools , particularly in the rural areas . Dr. Castro is apparently confident that he can make commercial and political arrangements with Moscow without losing the United States sugar market on which the economy of Cuba largely depends . He places elaborate advertisements in United States newspapers and magazines urging tourists to come here and then vilifies the United States in such a way as to frighten them away .","This has paralyzed the $50,000,000-a-year tourist trade with the United  deal with Moscow to sell sugar at the world price of 3 cents a pound or less just as the State Department is trying to keep Congress from cutting or eliminating his sugar subsidy , which amounts to more than $100,000 , - 000 a year . All the frenzy of activity , much of it contradictory , has clearly alarmed many of those influential Cubans who supported the revolution . It also has disturbed United States officials here who have been urging Washington to take a patient and understanding attitude toward Cuba 's problems . There is no doubt , in the opinion of experienced diplomats here , that local and imported Communists are trying to take advantage of the situation . In fact , they are now arguing that to be anti-Communist in Cuba is to be antiCastro and counter-revolutionary . In short , there is a growing feeling of insecurity here  --  of not knowing what is coming next .",1960

The problem concerned what language Congress would use to express its agreement with Ford 's determination that federal expenditures in 1977 should be held down .

Scheduled for announcement along with a forthcoming statement covering $300.000,000 of economic aid to Britain , the transaction was completed last week by the Economic Cooperation Administration . It was confirmed by the !","Mutual Security Agency after ' "" premature "" disclosure in London . The payment represents the dif- , ference , as of Nov. 30 , 1951 , be tween the amount of gold or dollars paid into the Payments Union on account of the deficit position of sterling in that agency and the amount that would have been paid had Britain not permitted the use of sterling balances held by other Marshall Plan countries in settling intra-European accounts through the Payments Union . Guarantee Won by Britain The guarantee arrangement was negotiated between Milton Katz , former United States special representative to Marshall Plan  State for Economic Affairs and subsequently Chancellor of the Exchequer . The agreement was signed June 7 , 1950 .","At that time the Organization for European Economic Cooperation , with some prodding from the E. C. A. , was trying to perfect a device for multilateral clearance of intra-European trade balances to take the place of the inter-European payments plan . The latter had been able to clear payments an a bilateral basis only . The United States , through the E. C. A. , was ready to put up a I working capital fund of $350,000 , - 000 to be drawn upon in the event that gold payments to creditor countries of the Payments Union exceeded gold receipts from debtor countries . However , - Britain demurred , fearing a-loss of gold and dollar reserves if member countries were permitted to apply : previously accumulated sterling balances to trade deficits . In the end , Britain was guaranteed against loss by the E. C. A. and Mr. Katz formalized this understanding in a letter to Mr. Gaitskell saying the United States Would "" indemnify the United Kingdom for  loss may have been caused by the use of sterling balances of net debtors in the settlement of their deficit with the European Payments Union . "" Britain 's Fears Justified With a basis thus provided for multilateral clearing of balances among all Marshall Plan countries , intra-European trade went ahead by leaps and bounds . But . Britain 's fears of the resulting losses in her ' reserves from use , of widely held ( sterling balances also proved well founded .","During the first year of the Payments Union 's operations , Britain realized a surplus in trade with other Countries in the Organization for European Economic Cooperation and received payment in gold from - the Payments Union . Since there was no drain on reserves , the E. C. A. paid no indemnity under the Katz-Gaitskell agreement . Last Summer , the trade balance of the United Kingdom with other participating countries changed from surplus to deficit and by Nov. 30 - this adverse balance with the Payments Union had reached $562,500,000 . After the previously accumulated surplus had been wiped out , the continued deficit required Britain to  as a result of October and November transactions . During the period of Payments Union operations , some other counltries had used $99,720,000 in accumulated sterling balances to I settle part of their accounts . Under ( the payment arrangements , this use of sterling balances had in creased the gold payments due from Britain to the Payments Union by $39,888,000 . U. S. Liability Continues . The guarantee agreement between the E. C. A. and Britain continues in effect until next June 30 and the United States will be liable for further payments if Britain finds it necessary to draw , further on her reserves . to keep ' current With the Payments Union . If , on the other hand , Britain should recover her surplus posit tion with other Payments member-countries , part of any.kOld she paid into the agency would be returned to the Mutual Security Agency . as successor to the ECA .

Originally it was planned to announce the grant before the arrival of Prime- Minister Churchill here this week , to avoid even the appearance of casting the British Government in the role of suppliant . More recently it has been suggested that - the announcement should follow Mr. Churchill 's departure from Washington . In any case , officials said today , only the finishing touches remained to be ; put on the use of $300,000,000 of transferable military aid funds for economic assistance to Britain to help keep up her rearmament program .",empty,empty,1952
