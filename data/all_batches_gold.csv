The economy is sufficiently resilient to cope with much sharper cuts in the military budget , by increased federal spending for civilian purposes , by tax reductions or , most likely , by a combination of both . <P> The committee , headed by Gardner Ackley , who is also Chairman of the  nation 's G.N.P .","will rise from the 1964 level of $629 billion to $870 billion by 1970 . Thus , at current tax rates the government will have an extra $50 billion in annual revenue by 1970 , even if military spending remains constant .","This is the committee 's "" conservative "" estimate . These funds , it recommended , should be pumped back into the economy to prevent recession . Hence the "" better life . ""","<P> The committee acknowledged that "" fiscal policies alone can not prevent problems of local distress and disruption "" that accompany shifts in arms spending . Changes in strategic planning , notably the switch from bombers to missiles , have already seriously hurt many industries and localities . Aircraft companies alone abolished nearly 50,000 jobs between 1962 and 1964 , largely as a result of declining military demand . In small communities such as Port Clinton , Ohio ( pop . 7,000 ) , which stands to lose 2,000 jobs when the Erie Army Depot closes next year , such shifts can be ruinous . The committee therefore urged continued research  technology . This , rather than any likelihood of widespread unemployment as a result of disarmament , is the Administration 's principal cutback worry .",empty,empty

U.S. private investment and tourism also pumped money into foreign economies , and American military spending overseas protected Allied countries-at the cost of spilling out an oversupply of dollars . <P> Benign Neglect . At home , possession of an overvalued dollar encouraged the illusion of American supremacy . But the U.S. paid a high price for that illusion in loss of markets to its overseas competitors , because American goods became artificially expensive in relation to foreign products . The world paid a high price too : the outflow of overvalued dollars to foreign countries helped spread inflation around the globe and robbed world finance of stability . <P> Less than a year ago , U.S. international financial policy was ruled by the idea of "" benign neglect "" : the complacent conviction that Americans could continue pouring out their overvalued dollars , buying as many foreign goods and factories as they chose and spending on military ventures as lavishly  so the theory went , had to absorb all the dollars because the dollar was as good as gold . It had an "" immutable "" value in terms of gold , and the U.S. was pledged to sell American gold-at the rate of $35 an ounce-in exchange for dollars that foreigners wished to cash in . But as foreigners piled up almost $50 billion in U.S. currency , while the U.S. gold stock melted to $10 billion , that pledge became hollow . Nixon gave it the coup de grce on Aug. 15 by decreeing that the U.S. would no longer redeem foreign-held dollars for gold .",empty,empty,empty,empty

This question has considerable bearing on prospects of a Senate drive to change the effective date to July 1 . As the House moved toward passage tomorrow of his tax reduction bill , Chairman Harold Knutson of the Ways and Means Committee said that Senator Robert A. Taft of Ohio was "" confused "" in stating that because of the retroactive feature revenue losses in the 1948 fiscal year would exceed House estimates by $1,900,000,000 . Mr. Knutson admitted , however , that the reduction in tax receipts during the year , which begins July 1 , would amount to $326,000,000 more than the $3,836,000,000 estimated in committee 's report to the House . He said that the committee 's figure merely showed how much the taxpayers ' total bill would be reduced in the twelve-month period while the new estimate of actual revenue losses took into account additional payments the Treasury would have to make during the year to refund overpayments made  's assertion that in the final analysis the bill 's retroactive provision would cost an additional $1,900 , - 000,000 in revenue losses . But he calculated that only part of the loss would be reflected in the 1948 fiscal year . The rest , according to his appraisal , would be divided between the fiscal years 1947 and 1949 in consequence of revised tax estimates to be made by taxpayers in the current fiscal year and a lag in other collections and refunds which would carry over into 1949 . The important question to many Republican members of Congress , however , is the tax bill 's effect on revenues in the 1948 fiscal year , since this is the year in which the party hopes to balance the budget and make a substantial payment on the national debt . Their program for accomplishment of these aims was predicated on estimates that tax reduction would cut anticipated revenues by $3,500,000,000 . The figure now has been raised to $4,162,000,000 at the least . Senate opponents of a retroactive tax cut were expected to capitalize on that point in seeking to  by Mr. Taft , who is chairman of the Senate Republican policy committee . Mr. Taft declined to comment today on Mr. Knutson 's statement , but he said that he believed the bill was a good one except for its retroactive feature .","He seemed confident the Senate would pass it without other substantial changes . House Passage Expected Democrats fought a losing battle against the measure during the first of two days ' debate in the House , and leaders of both parties predicted passage tomorrow . The House bound itself to make no changes in the bill by adopting with little controversy a Rules Committee recommendation to prohibit any amendments from the floor . Consequently , the bill must be passed , sent back to the Ways and Means Committee or defeated . Democrats generally admitted privately the futility of opposition , and their position was stated frankly to the House by Representative Adolph J. Sabath of Illinois , former chairman of the Rules Committee . "" I realize that you will pass this bill , "" he said , pointing to the Republican side of the chamber  that you have the majority and can do it . But you will regret it . The American people will realize that you should have dealt more fairly with the low-income groups . "" The House prepared for a final vote tomorrow with Republicans almost solidly behind the bill , which gives relief to all taxpayers . Persons with net taxable income of $1,000 or less a year ( after deductions and exemptions ) would receive a 30 per cent cut and most others would get a 20 per cent reduction . The opposition , led by Representative Robert L. Doughton , Democrat , of North Carolina , was based largely on the argument that enactment might preclude any payment of the $260,000,000 national debt . "" To date , "" Mr. Doughton said , "" hopes of a balanced Federal budget still are but hopes . Only when payments are made on the debt from the proceeds of taxation will we be able to feel that the nation actually is on its way out of the fiscal wilderness into which the war plunged us . "" He asserted that there  requested by President Truman in his budget message would be exceeded when all appropriations bills for the 1948 fiscal year were passed . He called attention specifically to requirements of $400,000,000 for aid to Greece and Turkey , other foreign expenditures ' that may become necessary and about $300 , - 000,000 in benefits to agriculture now being considered .","These were not included in the Truman budget . The opponents argued also that the bill gave a disproportionate amount of reductions to wealthy taxpayers . "" Under the guise of tax reduction it was intended as a windfall for the rich and a handout for the poor , "" said Representative Walter . Lynch , Democrat , of New York .","Mr. Knutson and other . Republicans emphasized the need for giving middle and high income groups relief to stimulate enterprise and free venture capital for investment , thus maintaining prosperity .",""" It is a fair bill , "" Mr. Knutson said , "" because it puts the axe to punitive taxes designed by alien minds and whizzed through subservient Congresses  --  a tax program that fitted neatly into  all Americans and make of this a nation of automatons . "" Representative Robert W. Kean , Republican , of New Jersey , accused the Democrats of using "" trick figures "" in attempting to show that lower-bracket taxpayers would receive smaller reductions than others .

When Prime Minister Atlee in Commons today offered personal assurances that the forthcoming Anglo-American conferences to revise two clauses in the credit agreement between the two countries "" would not cut across the Paris conference , "" he was repairing one of the , strains that have arisen between Washington and London . There was feeling in high quartos ' here , - and it was conveyed to the Labor Government , that the British crisis was being handled by that government in the very way disclaimed officially by Mr. Attlee . Since the Paris conference , which began with Soviet Russia and its satellites abstaining from the discussion of the Marshall proposal  --  for which the conference was called , is a continuous session , Britain 's recent moves were giving this unfortunate impression to e.dministration officials and influential members of , Congress . And some were asking bluntly whether the United Kingdom was not trying to get priority on admission to the benefits of the Marshall proposal . An Idea Resented The Labor Government has appeared to certain high officials and  of "" deadlineitis . "" Its decision to withdraw from Greece and Turkey was announced so suddenly to Washington that Secretary of State Marshall had only a few hours to devise a policy with which to - meet the situation before he left for Moscow . Congreso , it is true , ignored the "" deadline "" of March 31 , named by the British and suggested by the administration for action on the Greek-Turkish bill that.was the first --  -- and so far the only ? application of the Truman Doctrine . But the idea of so immediate a deadline was widely resented .","Reminders From Washington The British , it is ' also felt by persons in authority and by unofficial experts , have been dwelling too much on their weaknesses and scarcities and not enough on their reserves and their strengths , fiscally and otherwise . Very little was said in official London about the gold reserve and the easy hours on the production line in Britain until the government there was sharply reminded of these things by visitors from Washington . And it was necessary to tell the British pointedly on  in the Ruhr , had best wait on the immediate necessities of production . If or when the Washington-London correspondence on these subjects , and the notes made of conversations abroad by our officials , are published , it will be apparent , even to the most confirmed critics of the administration , that the State Department has followed a - firm admonitory course and other Federal units have not abated it .

Find out what each claimant country in Europe really needs . 3 . Estimate what needs the United States can supply . 4 . Itemize how these countries managed their resources before World War II . 5 . Find out how many dollars these countries have spent for commodities , and how many securities they have cashed for the same purpose . 6 . Find out what they have been spending the dollars for , and if there is hoarding . 7 . Have the data assayed by experts wholly capable to evaluate them . 8 . Then offer to go to the limit of our capacity , adding that for a given number of years the United States will buy from anyone non-perishable raw material , even if it is non-critical. 9 . If Soviet Russia and satellite nations should inquire whether this is not "" economic . imperialism , "" or make that charge , reply : "" No , it Is not , for you can come  . Everybody , everywhere , "" work and save .",""" Offer of Hope As a subfoundation of this recovery formula , its advocates propose three security strata for the United States itself without which the superstructure would crumble . These are military and economic strength sufficient to protect national security , and ethical strength , expressed in meticulous discharge of all national obligations and pledges . If all this were done , the world would not immediately be swept of perils or the Marshall Plan of difficulties . There is still the blocking tactic of Russia .

In recent years , American officials have picvrtcly offered Greek governments much more pointed "" ads ice "" on such %at-led matters as the drafting of a new civil-service code and even their national budgets There have been frequent reports of similat behind-thescenes pressures exerted in the internal affairs of certain other countries . America 's attempts at intervention in the affairs of other nations are more obvious in the field of foreign policy .","The threat to withhold aid has been used to bludgeon nur Western European allies into , embarking  or necessary . It has beenused to draw acceptance of German rearmament from nations which really do n't want the Germans rearmed ? the French , the British , even the German people themselves . But what domestic or foreignpolicy measures can achieve real success if they lack popular backing at home and if the people who must carry them out come to feel that they are imported from the U. S. A We do n't like other countries meddling in our affairs  --  and proud peoples the world over feel the came way . American attempts to influence their actions can only create a legacy of ill will toward this country . American intervention in the affairs of other nations is not , however , the fault of officials on the spot . like Ambassador Peurifov . It is implicit in the U. S. program for appropriating billions in foreign aid each year . The man who hands out the dollars can hardly be blamed for trying to get the recipients to spend his money in the most efficient way . The good will that America seeks to build abroad  defense efforts . That is the danger of global largesse .",empty,empty,empty,empty

WASHINGTON , July 10 ? President Eisenhr'wer requested the Kremlin today to allow the United States to send $15,000,000 worth of food through the Iron Curtain to alleviate the hunger of Germans under Soviet control . The White House released early in the evening a note containing the food offer that was delivered in Moscow to Andrei Y. Vishinsky , Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister , by Elim O'Shaughnessy , United States Charg ? d'Affaires . The proposal to send the food grew out of a plea for aid that Dr. Konrad Adenauer , West German Chancellor , addressed to President Eisenhower July 4 . Dr. Adenauer said that the food supply of East Germany was endangered by Soviet policies and that the West German Government was planning to send food into the Soviet zone . From the abundant surplus stocks of the United States , grains , sugar , lard , soybean oil and some other commodities would be rushed through Berlin , gateway in  the United States proposal .","Soviet Placed in Dilemma While there were no indications that President Eisenhower 's offer to East Germany was released today as a propaganda move in connection with the purging of Lavrenti P. Beria from the Kremlin triumvirate yesterday , the development may well cause added embarrassment to an obviously harassed Soviet officialdom . There was no indication whether Russia would accept the offer , but obviously it posed a dilemma for the Kremlin . If the offer were accepted , it would entail a further loss of prestige for the Soviet Government in , the wake of the uprising of German workers June 17 and the continuing unrest in East Germany and in other satellite countries . If it were rejected , the subjugated people would be informed that a humanitarian program of I the United States had been cast aside , and this quite likely would increase the unrest . The President 's proposal was to be broadcast by the Voice of America , which has an outlet in BIAS ( Radio in the American Sector of Berlin ) which blankets the Soviet zone of  food delivered , officials here expected the impact to compare i somewhat with the Berlin airlift as nn example of the strength and the humanity of the free world on the Western side of the Iron Curtain . President Eisenhower invited other free countries to join the effort to aid the people of East Germany "" in this emergency . "" Reply Sent to Adenauer General Eisenhower sent his reply to Chancellor Adenauer today , at the same time that Mr. O'Shaughnessy went to the Kremlin with the formal note . The note not only stated that the United States traditionally sought to alleviate suffering , starvation and disease wherever it might occur , but it also sought to lay a specific diplomatic basis for the action in these words : "" Because of its position as an occupying power in Germany , my Government has a legitimate interest in the weltire of the people of Germany . "" The note expressed the President 's "" deep concern with the conditions existing in the Soviet zone of Germany and the increasing hardships to which the population of that area is being  the United States are especially concerned over , the steadily deteriorating food supply for the population of that area which has been an important factor in resent demonstrations against the local authorities , "" the note added . The offer was expressed thus : "" Mindful of these needs , my Government has , therefore , decided to offer to the Soviet Union as the occupying power for distribution to the population of Eastern // Germany shipments of food amounting in value to approximately $15,000,000 and consisting of grain , sugar , lard , soybean oil and some other commodities . "" The note stated that delivery and distribution could be worked out by the respective High Commissioners in Germany .","In a statement announcing his action , President Eisenhower said he had directed John Foster Dulles , Secretary of State , and the Mutual Security Administrator to see that the food "" is made available in Germany without delay . "" In his reply to Chancellor Adenauer , President Eisenhower said that the serious situation in East Germany reported in his letter of July 4 had been confirmed in the  Commissioner in Germany .","The situation has been one "" of considerable concern to me over the past few weeks , "" he added . "" It is true , "" Chancellor Adenauer had written , "" that the events of 17 June 1953 have prompted the rulers of the Soviet zone to announce , in this particular field certain relaxations , but according to information received by us , it is extremely doubtful whether the Communist rulers are actually willing , or able , to fulfill these promises . Therefore , the food sup ' ply of the Soviet zone must continue to be regarded as definitely endangered . "" The Chancellor added that , unfortunately , West Germany could not relieve the political pressure of Germans under Soviet control , but it felt an obligation at least to act against hunger . Consequently , by resolution of the Bundestag , the West German Government is planning to use funds on a large scale for food to be sent into the Soviet zone through churches and charitable organizations , Dr. Adenauer said .

S. GESTURE BY CASTRO IS SEEN Moscow Deal Said to Show Stress on Independence ?,"Red Influence Noted By JAMES RESTON Speen I to The New York Tams . HAVANA , Feb. 14 ? The Cuban Government is consciously moving closer to the Soviet Union to demonstrate its in , dependence of the United States . This seems to be the opinion of most well-informed diplomats here the day after Cuba 's sign ; ing of a commercial and political agreement with First Deputy Premier Anastas I. Mikoyan of the Soviet Union . Some members of the diplomatic corps place a more extreme interpretation on the trend of events . They believe Premier Fidel Castro is moving left not only as a tactic to balance the economic influence of Washington but for ideological reasons . Even those diplomats who think Dr. Castro is merely trying to get everything he can from both Washington and Moscow agree that Communist influence is growing in Havana and might even get beyond the Premier 's control . The Mikoyan-Castro agree-ment provides a twelve-year ( credit of 5100,000,000 at 2  tons of sugar for dollars over a five.","year period . The accord stipulates that Moscow is to fur , nish technical assistance to Cuba during the period 1961-64 , if requested , for "" the construction of plants and factories for the Cuban Government . "" Even before the announce // ment it had been noted here that Dr. Castro was bringing in non-Cuban experts , some of them with extreme Leftist if not Communist backgrounds , to help him organize his . Government . This trend is expected to increase as a result of the agreement , under which the Soviet Union will provide experts to maintain the machinery if requested . Yesterday 's communiqu ?","also stated that the Soviet-Cuban conversations were conducted "" in an atmosphere of frank cordiality "" that showed the interest of both nations "" to collaborate actively "" in the United Nations "" in favor of the coexistence , cooperation and friendship of all peoples of the world . "" This was interpreted by diplomats here as meaning that Cuba was likely to work with the Soviet and Asian-African blocs in the United Nations  often support , is gradually losing its majority in the General Assembly . Cuban- officials denied today that the agreement was anything more than the kind of commercial arrangement made by the United States with Communist Poland . They repeated Dr. Castro 's familiar theme that Cuba wanted to be independent of both capitalism and communism . Communism , they said , quoting Dr. Castro , is a form of social organization that "" gives you food without liberty , "" while capitalism "" gives you liberty and starves you to death . "" Cuba , they insisted , is building a system of organized "" humanism , "" which they defined as "" bread without fear and liberty without terror . "" What seems to impress objective observers of the Cuban revolution , however , is not so much the emotional rhetoric of officials as the disorganization of the Government in dealing with practical economic problems . Present State of Nation Thirteen months after Dr. Castro established his Government , there seems to be general agreement in the diplomatic corps on these points : 9The Premier is rapidly breaking up  government that in many ways resembles national socialism even more than communism . ciHe has lost considerable support among the professional , middle and intellectual classes that supported his revolution , but still has great support among the workers and peasants and is the only symbol of authority in Cuba .","He has proved to be better at destroying power than at building a constructive and well-organized Government . His revolution is going through that difficult and "" even dangerous transition between the tearing down and the building up , and he is tearing down faster than he is building  --  though there is evidence of considerable construction of houses and schools , particularly in the rural areas . Dr. Castro is apparently confident that he can make commercial and political arrangements with Moscow without losing the United States sugar market on which the economy of Cuba largely depends . He places elaborate advertisements in United States newspapers and magazines urging tourists to come here and then vilifies the United States in such a way as to frighten them away .","This has paralyzed the $50,000,000-a-year tourist trade with the United  deal with Moscow to sell sugar at the world price of 3 cents a pound or less just as the State Department is trying to keep Congress from cutting or eliminating his sugar subsidy , which amounts to more than $100,000 , - 000 a year . All the frenzy of activity , much of it contradictory , has clearly alarmed many of those influential Cubans who supported the revolution . It also has disturbed United States officials here who have been urging Washington to take a patient and understanding attitude toward Cuba 's problems . There is no doubt , in the opinion of experienced diplomats here , that local and imported Communists are trying to take advantage of the situation .

We hope the Congress will give quick , and sympathetic - attention to the legislation he requests .","The most interesting innovation proposed by the President is what amounts to a two-price system for savings . The President . wants the Federal Reserve Board to be empowered to establish higher interest rates for savings deposits kept here by foreign Governments or monetary  . The objective , of course , is to obtain a weapon which can be used to keep this country competitive in the international competition for short-term funds .","The recent relatively low rates of interest for such funds here as compared with rates available abroad have played a major role in our unfavorable balance of payments and high rate of gold loss this past year . There is a precedent for this , of course , in the somewhat similar authorization with respect to Government bonds which Congress granted in the Second Liberty Bond Act . Much of the President 's message appears to be beyond controversy . The need for more effective performance by our economic system , the importance of increasing exports by lowering costs and introducing superior technology , the desirability of a major effort to spur foreign tourism here , the wisdom of providing more adequate Government financing aids for our exporters , these and many other of the President 's proposals seem incontrovertible . They have , in fact , long been urged by many quarters and the only mystery is why it has taken  's message was delivered yesterday the anticipation of some such imaginative and vigorous program last week caused an end to the gold rush in London and sent world confidence in the dollar to a new high in recent months .","But if that happy situation is to continue , all of us will have to contribute to the major effort required to bring our international financial situation back into proper balance and keep it there . Union and corporation officials , for example , will have to make wage and price decisions with an understanding of the importance of keeping our goods and services competitive on the world market . The President , happily , has rejected that most unpleasant device for defending the dollar , exchange controls , but if he is to be able to maintain that position we shall all have to show a high self-discipline and awareness of the dangers that could threaten the dollar as we make our individual and business decisions as to what we buy and where we invest .               @ @ @ @ @ @",empty,empty

The President has been employing every possible occasion to demonstrate a determination , which has finally impressed even the speculators in gold , to protect the dollar from further debasement . For example , he told his second news conference that "" With every new spending program we send * * * we will suggest a source of revenue for it . "" And this policy is generally accepted as one of the strongest safeguards against all forms of inflation . The President and most of his influential ? economic advisers seem to place reliance on a source of this revenue that is theoretical as contrasted with such solid sources as those additional taxes the ? traffic will bear . This theory is that certain kinds of extra spending will stimulate the economy  --  among other stimulations , reducing unemployment  --  thus producing new revenue for the treasury . Such spending , known as pump-priming , failed to attain these objectives during the New Deal , despite the billions it consumed . So until it is clear how much President Kennedy will  , there can be no measure of the ability of this method to contribute to the revenue required to effect the President 's policy of balancing Federal outgo with Federal income . There is , however , a demonstrable check against waste and inflationary spending that the President has not mentioned in his messages and statements thus far . It has been sought by and for Presidents ever since 1876 , and as steadily denied by Congress , although most of the states have granted it to their Governors .","This is the so-called "" item veto "" power whereby the President can refuse to approve certain appropriations in a Federal supply bill without disapproving the entire measure . President Eisenhower requested this power from Congress more often than any of his predecessors , but with no more success . Even though Congress has given this authority to Governors of our territories and insular possessions , and in extending it by statute to Presidents would retain the same power to override an item veto that it has to repass an entire measure , dissenters to the request have easily prevailed on  expand the President 's power . For the same political reasons he could use it to strike out state and local appropriations to punish members of Congress and communities , and retain others with less justification .","The "" pork "" in appropriation bills ? the financing of pet , extravagant and other wholly unnecessary projects  --  would not be removed ; it would simply be weighed and allocated at the White House instead of at the Capitol . As a constitutional amendment , the plan would be out of harmony with the Constitution , which restricts to Congress the power of the purse . As a statute RI would be unconstitutional . The Stone Wall in Congress In a study made for Speaker Bankhead in 1937 , Representative Hatton Sumners , a most respected ( legislator , concluded that these objections would be met if the Presidential item veto were restricted in advance by Congress to certain specified items in specified bills . But Congress was as hostile to this proposal , by which all its power was retained , as to the plea for a full grant of the  a year before . In one of the strongest arguments since the matter was laid before Congress and the people by President Grant , Vandenberg said : - It does not give the Presi- , dent one single additional affirmative power . He can not start anything as a result .","He can only stop something long enough to focus the attention of the country on it , and long enough to force two-thirds of the House and Senate to agree to it the vetoed item in spite of him and his reasons , if they should persist in their adverse judgments . Its only harm , if any , would lie in the temporary delay while Congress and the country stop , look and listen . * * * Without ' this item veto the budget * * can become a * * * wooden gun . If President Kennedy could get this authority he would have a most effective , immediate and self-evident means of regularly balancing spending and revenue . And , though Congress once more might decline , he will never know if he does n't make  this to rally public opinion behind it .",empty,empty

Also , political considerations , especially in a Presidential election year , are always reflected in the product  --  this time Mr. Johnson 's awareness that the Republicans hope to exploit the national anxiety over rapidly rising Federal spending as their best campaign issue of 1964 . With these factors acutely in mind , the President prepared budget and spending estimates in which the unavoidable element of speculative calculation was tempered by a statement of policy reversing the immediate Democratic past . The mood of the message was fiscally "" conservative , "" on the test of the eventual reckoning of costs and receipts . Its tone was one of strict frugality .

But the effort will require him to face up to some very hard choices he thus far has postponed . For instance , he has retained as the basis of his fiscal policy the huge tax cut plan of his predecessor , to be made in a rising cycle of Government spending and deficits . If meanwhile the tax cut does not prove the validity of its inherent theory that it will propel the economy upward and unemployment downward , inflation and greater rather than lesser Government spending will be the logical consequences . The ' Unexpended Balances ' Conclusive proofs of the Johnson pudding  fact before the fiscal reckoning on June 30 , 1965 . But the President could explore one means of making the proof more positive by a thorough overhaul of the problem of the unexpended balances in the regular Federal budget accounts ( exclusive of trust funds ) . At the start of the current fiscal year these amounted to about $87 billion , of which $45 billion were still "" unobligated "" by spending or spending commitment .

class='both' style='color: green'>bill</span> hostage to force the <span class='both' style='color: green'>House</span> to give his <span class='both' style='color: green'>committee</span> junket money and other expanded <span class='dim_f' style='color: blue'>appropriations</span> .<br>3.- The <span class='both' style='color: green'>committee</span> has a duty to repudiate any such unconscionable maneuver by insisting on an immediate appraisal of the strengths and weaknesses of this crucial piece of <span class='both' style='color: green'>legislation</span> .<br>4.- The major provision of the proposals ?<br>5.- $1 <span class='both' style='color: green'>billion</span> in <span class='both' style='color: green'>aid</span> to districts with many children from low-<span class='dim_f' style='color: blue'>income</span> <span class='both' style='color: green'>families</span>  --  has met with virtually universal acclaim .<br>6.- It offers an opportunity to redouble <span class='both' style='color: green'>educational</span> efforts where they are most urgently needed and most frequently neglected  --  in the urban slums .<br>7.- To those who object on the grounds that this is an attempt to tell the states how to distribute the <span class='both' style='color: green'>education</span> dollar the answer must be that the state <span class='both' style='color: green'>legislatures</span> have generally been deaf to urban needs .<br>8.- There is , however , a technical defect in this part of the <span class='both' style='color: green'>President</span>  are to be defined as fitting into the low-<span class='dim_f' style='color: blue'>income</span> bracket .<br>9.- The maximum of $2,000 in annual <span class='dim_f' style='color: blue'>income</span> is too low .<br>10.- It would eliminate thousands of <span class='both' style='color: green'>families</span> who , as in New York City , get more than that amount in annual <span class='both' style='color:

<span class='both' style='color: green'>welfare</span> <span class='both' style='color: green'>policy</span> , as New York would thus be .<br>12.- The substantive controversy stirred up by the <span class='both' style='color: green'>President</span> 's proposals arises from two facets of the <span class='both' style='color: green'>aid</span> <span class='both' style='color: green'>program</span> .<br>","1.- One involves <span class='both' style='color: green'>grants</span> for textbooks and teaching materials .<br>2.- The other provides shared facilities , benefiting both parochial and <span class='both' style='color: green'>public</span> <span class='both' style='color: green'>schools</span> , in the proposed new supplementary <span class='both' style='color: green'>education</span> centers .<br>3.- The <span class='both' style='color: green'>President</span> 's intent was clearly to offer a compromise which , while reassuring those who want to preserve the vital principle of separation of church and state , would placate the opposition , largely Roman Catholic , which has been successful in the past in blocking all <span class='both' style='color: green'>Federal</span> <span class='both' style='color: green'>school</span> <span class='both' style='color: green'>aid</span> .<br>4.- The question here is whether the Johnson proposals go too far toward compromising the principle of church-state separation and the spirit of the Constitution  ought to remain whether <span class='both' style='color: green'>Federal</span> <span class='both' style='color: green'>aid</span> to other than <span class='both' style='color: green'>public</span> <span class='both' style='color: green'>education</span> benefits individual children or supports institutions .<br>5.- The first , as the <span class='both' style='color: green'>Supreme Court</span> has ruled in the case of <span class='both' style='color: green'>school</span> lunch <span class='both' style='color: green'>programs</span> and even the provision of textbooks , appears to be constitutional , while direct support of church-related <span class='both' style='color: green'>schools</span>

inexcusable stalling action by Chairman Adam Clayton Powell has been blocking approval of President Johnson 's aid to education proposals by the House Education and Labor Committee . The Administration suspects that Mr. Powell is holding the bill hostage to force the House to give his committee junket money and other expanded appropriations . The committee has a duty to repudiate any such unconscionable maneuver by insisting on an immediate appraisal of the strengths and weaknesses of this crucial piece of legislation . The major provision of the proposals ? $1 billion in aid to districts with many children from low-income families  --  has met with virtually universal acclaim . It offers an opportunity to redouble educational efforts where they are most urgently needed and most frequently neglected  --  in the urban slums . To those who object on the grounds that this is an attempt to tell the states how to distribute the education dollar the answer must be that the state legislatures have generally been deaf to urban needs . There is , however , a technical defect in this part of the President  are to be defined as fitting into the low-income bracket . The maximum of $2,000 in annual income is too low . It would eliminate thousands of families who , as in New York City , get more than that amount in annual welfare payments . Surely no community should be penalized for a relatively liberal welfare policy , as New York would thus be . The substantive controversy stirred up by the President 's proposals arises from two facets of the aid program .","One involves grants for textbooks and teaching materials . The other provides shared facilities , benefiting both parochial and public schools , in the proposed new supplementary education centers . The President 's intent was clearly to offer a compromise which , while reassuring those who want to preserve the vital principle of separation of church and state , would placate the opposition , largely Roman Catholic , which has been successful in the past in blocking all Federal school aid . The question here is whether the Johnson proposals go too far toward compromising the principle of church-state separation and the spirit of the Constitution  ought to remain whether Federal aid to other than public education benefits individual children or supports institutions . The first , as the Supreme Court has ruled in the case of school lunch programs and even the provision of textbooks , appears to be constitutional , while direct support of church-related schools is not .","In states like New York , which have exceptionally specific and strict prohibitions in their Constitutions , the courts will undoubtedly have to give the final verdict on some parts of the Johnson program .

"" Almost immediately , the Department of Housing and Urban Development disclosed plans to provide rent subsidies for tenants in an additional 118,000 public housing units , an increase of more than 50 per cent from the 211,000 units provided in the budget . Altho the dollar amount is relatively small , it could provide stimulus to the depressed housing industry and is an example of how the administration intends to avert a recession .","AS PREVIOUSLY reported , the federal budget for the year beginning next AII3 ' 1 anticipates a deficit of at least $9.4 billion . Overall spending would be increased by nearly $30 billion from fiscal 1979 . Nixon emphasized that about 90 per cent of the increased outlays represents higher spending built into current law . Defense spending would total $85.6 billion , up $6.3 billion from the current fiscal year . And for the first time in history , federal income security payments  --  basically Social Security , public assistance and services , and other retirement and social insurance programs ? will exceed $100 billion . Except for the  companies from profiteering on the energy shortage , Nixon recommended no new taxes .","If adopted by Congress , the windfall profits tax would bring in about $3 billion in fiscal 1975 . In addition , he urged Congress to adopt the tax reform and simplification program he submitted last year . Unlike the tough , restrictive budget of a year ago in which the President concentrated on eliminating or cutting back dozens of programs in an effort to old the line on prices , the central theme of the new budget is preventing a recession induced by the fuel shortEge . THE BUDGET contains the previously announced $1.5 billion for energy research and development as part of "" Project Independence , "" and new funds for mass transit systems , including a major shift in policy to permit state and Budget75 local governments to use mass transit funds for operating subsidies . Nixon said his budget , which amounts to spending nearly $1,500 for every man , woman , and child in the country , is tantamount to an economic tight rope in that federal spending increases are held to  economic slowdown threatens a socially  --  and politically  --  unacceptable level of unemployment .","Budget bureau officials have developed a number of contingency plans to stimulate the economy , including accelerated spending for federal construction or procurement , tax relief , and public service jobs . Malek told newsmen the administration is prepared to increase federal spending from $1 qillion to $5 billion more to prevent a recession . However , he said , "" We do n't expect to have to use these stimuli . We believe we have a good budget . "" If such stimulation is needed , Malek said , the administration will look first to those programs that would not require legislative action .",He cited the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act as an example . Local government agencies could at their option shift the emphasis of the program into providing public service jobs for areas with high unemployment . THE PRESIDENT 'S new spending program reflects to a large extent the effects of inflation as well as the energy shortages .,"Government , like consumers , will be paying higher prices for fuel for its  million for higher military fuel costs . Wage and price increases account for more than half the $6.3 billion increase in the defense budget . The remainder of the funds will be used to begin development of new weapons systems and to remunitions and equipment depleted during the Arab-Israeli war and in military assistance to South Viet Nam under the Paris peace agreement . Once again the administration is seeking authority to eliminate spending under the H i 1 1 - Burton Act , contending that the United States has more hospital rooms than it needs . Oter spending reductions proposed in the budget include federal aid to impacted school districts , and a $1.3 billion cut in agriculture and rural development programs . Part of this reduction reflects lower commodity subsidies payments and the sale of rural housing assets , mainly mortgages ."

He would have permanent authority to i earrange agencies subject only to disapproval by both houses of Congress within 60 days after the submission of a reorganization plan . Though it did not specifically exempt any agencies , it did require that separate plans be submitted far seven big ones . The Senate has received a bill but has not acted on it . It would give exemptions to none of the seven agencies mentioned under the House bill . Instead of giving the President permanent authority , it would end the matter April 1 , 1953 .

Forty-five of the 60-odd top agencies of the executix e branch engage in operations affecting foreign policy and , due to lack of clear responsibility and integration , often step on each others ' toes or fail to winnow their information so the President gets pertinent facts .

Another 17 could be handled through appropriation bills . But 100 others v ould require supporting legislation from Congress .","Citizens Committee Thus , for closer consolidation of the three armed services under the Secretary of Defense . Mr. Truman could do much , but Congress itself would have to pass a law demoting the three service secretaries to be undersecretaries without the right of direct appeal to Mr. Truman . A Citizens .

One difficulty is that policy issues are involved in many decisions to merge or abolish agencies .","Should the post office deficit be wiped out , for  government subsidy to newspapers and magazines through low second-class postage rates . Another typical case is the objection of the Railway Labor Executives ' Association to any change being made in such agencies as the National Mediation Board , Railroad Adjustment Board and the like . Most government agencies think reorganization would be floc  --  for all but themselves . Nearly every agency has friends in Congress . That is why Congress never has been able to tackle the whole problem . There was too much logrolling by friends of one agency who combined with friends of another to block change .

Scheduled for announcement along with a forthcoming statement covering $300.000,000 of economic aid to Britain , the transaction was completed last week by the Economic Cooperation Administration . It was confirmed by the !","Mutual Security Agency after ' "" premature "" disclosure in London . The payment represents the dif- , ference , as of Nov. 30 , 1951 , be tween the amount of gold or dollars paid into the Payments Union on account of the deficit position of sterling in that agency and the amount that would have been paid had Britain not permitted the use of sterling balances held by other Marshall Plan countries in settling intra-European accounts through the Payments Union . Guarantee Won by Britain The guarantee arrangement was negotiated between Milton Katz , former United States special representative to Marshall Plan  State for Economic Affairs and subsequently Chancellor of the Exchequer . The agreement was signed June 7 , 1950 .","At that time the Organization for European Economic Cooperation , with some prodding from the E. C. A. , was trying to perfect a device for multilateral clearance of intra-European trade balances to take the place of the inter-European payments plan . The latter had been able to clear payments an a bilateral basis only . The United States , through the E. C. A. , was ready to put up a I working capital fund of $350,000 , - 000 to be drawn upon in the event that gold payments to creditor countries of the Payments Union exceeded gold receipts from debtor countries . However , - Britain demurred , fearing a-loss of gold and dollar reserves if member countries were permitted to apply : previously accumulated sterling balances to trade deficits . In the end , Britain was guaranteed against loss by the E. C. A. and Mr. Katz formalized this understanding in a letter to Mr. Gaitskell saying the United States Would "" indemnify the United Kingdom for  loss may have been caused by the use of sterling balances of net debtors in the settlement of their deficit with the European Payments Union . "" Britain 's Fears Justified With a basis thus provided for multilateral clearing of balances among all Marshall Plan countries , intra-European trade went ahead by leaps and bounds . But . Britain 's fears of the resulting losses in her ' reserves from use , of widely held ( sterling balances also proved well founded .","During the first year of the Payments Union 's operations , Britain realized a surplus in trade with other Countries in the Organization for European Economic Cooperation and received payment in gold from - the Payments Union . Since there was no drain on reserves , the E. C. A. paid no indemnity under the Katz-Gaitskell agreement . Last Summer , the trade balance of the United Kingdom with other participating countries changed from surplus to deficit and by Nov. 30 - this adverse balance with the Payments Union had reached $562,500,000 . After the previously accumulated surplus had been wiped out , the continued deficit required Britain to  as a result of October and November transactions . During the period of Payments Union operations , some other counltries had used $99,720,000 in accumulated sterling balances to I settle part of their accounts . Under ( the payment arrangements , this use of sterling balances had in creased the gold payments due from Britain to the Payments Union by $39,888,000 . U. S. Liability Continues . The guarantee agreement between the E. C. A. and Britain continues in effect until next June 30 and the United States will be liable for further payments if Britain finds it necessary to draw , further on her reserves . to keep ' current With the Payments Union . If , on the other hand , Britain should recover her surplus posit tion with other Payments member-countries , part of any.kOld she paid into the agency would be returned to the Mutual Security Agency . as successor to the ECA . Meanwhile , . the resumption of economic aid ""  - -  tet- Britain , ' which was I terminated a year ago , appeared to be blocked by official indecision as to how announcement of the  made . Originally it was planned to announce the grant before the arrival of Prime- Minister Churchill here this week , to avoid even the appearance of casting the British Government in the role of suppliant . More recently it has been suggested that - the announcement should follow Mr. Churchill 's departure from Washington . In any case , officials said today , only the finishing touches remained to be ; put on the use of $300,000,000 of transferable military aid funds for economic assistance to Britain to help keep up her rearmament program .",empty,empty

The Secretary of the Treasury will take some unpleasant , though familiar , news to President Eisenhower in Denver tomorrow .","George M.

This report will be based on preliminary indications of spending in the next budget . These show that outlays will be little , if any , less ' than in the current fiscal year , which began July 1 .

It was the third since the , President was stricken Sept. 24 with a moderate heart attack . The only Cabinet member absent was Postmaster General Arthur E. Summeffield . It is taken for granted that Congress will insist on some sort of tax cut in 1956 , a Presidential election year , although both Democrats and Republicans are said to be aware that it ? should not be too great . Another problem that Mr. Humphrey presumably will discuss with the President is the connection of tax reduction and the business situation . Assuming that spending can be reduced little if at all , as seems likely , about the only hope for any tax cut would arise from an economic boom . This would drive up receipts and allow a reduction  tax reduction bad economics , in the view of Administration econ // omists . They believe that it would stimulate further an already potentially inflationary situation .

Looking further ahead , those in close touch with the military situation think the slow climb is likely to turn into a steep one by fall . The problem is less what is needed in Vietnam , which is a lot , than what the President feels able to demand openly in a period when the economy is queazy and has to be kept in balance . It also is a matter of what the President feels is politically necessary .

Noting that President Franklin D. Roosevelt had "" inspired a nation with the Four Freedoms "" 30 years ago , Mr. Johnson listed "" five new freedoms ? the new freedoms we are trying to win for America in our time . "" He said they were "" The freedom to earn a decent living from a full-time job , "" the "" freedom to own a decent home , "" the freedom of every , citizen to "" get all the education that he or she can absorb , "" "" freedom from discrimination "" and the right "" of every American to as healthy a life as modern medicine can provide . "" "" Jobs , homes , health , education , "" he said , "" four simple words that can mean every- thing in a person 's life  --  all without discrimination . That 's what things are all about these days . ""","The President listed the accomplishments of his Administration to help assure these freedoms , including reduction of the number of citizens in poverty , the new housing discrimination ban ,  laws in the last five years and doubling of annual Federal health expenditures to $16-billion in the last five years . He was warmly received during the 45-minute talk by the 2,300 doctors and guests present , particularly when he reeled off a long list of his Administration 's achievements fort Negroes . He ' also appealed "" to the entire medical profession to exercise restraint in their fees and charges "" to help control Medicare costs . And he pounded the lectern to emphasize an appeal for law and order , saying , "" No man  --  not even the President  --  has a right to say what law he will abide by and what law he wo n't abide by . "" Mr. Johnson did not specifically refer in his speech to Mr. Nixon or the Republicans , but he observed that "" Presidents are not the only analysts on the scene today . "" He omitted , in delivering the speech , the statements about those who say the nation is on its "" deathbed "" or "" in bad health . "" But aides said he stood  at the LBJ Ranch to make the speech , his first public appearance since he came to Texas nearly two weeks ago . He returned afterward to the ranch , where he has been working and relaxing . Mr. Johnson renewed his appeal for "" new ways to improve "" Medicare , putting heavy emphasis on his recent proposals for extending coverage for mothers and children from the prenatal period through a child 's first year . "" Call it Kiddycare or whatever other name you will  --  but one day the healing hand of Medicare must reach out to every child in America , "" Mr. Johnson said . "" This will be the best investment we can make in our future . """,empty,empty

Evidence of this is a group of 100 Korean war veterans . at Boston University who organized last night to ask for more money . The government allotment ? as well as other factors ?,is apparently causing a smaller pro .. portion of veterans to head back to school than after World War II . A national news magazine has reported that one in ten Korean war veterans is now in school  --  while more than half the World War II GIs used their education benefits at the peak of their enrollment . This raises the question whether it would be in the national interest to increase veterans ' allotments .

Cost Dwarfs Allotment Meanwhile minimum expenses at many universities have gone up this fall , A year at a top-ranking eastern college like Harvard , Yale , or the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is expected to cost about $1,800 . This includes  , room , clothes , and books , with very few extras .","Tuition at state universities is much lower ? $200 at the University of Massachusetts . The United States Office of Education is carrying on a nationwide study now to see whether the lower government allotment is causing an abnormally large proportion to seek out low-tuition schools . At many large universities , such as Boston University , tuition ranges between $500 and $600 .","Extra fees may add up to $50 . Most colleges are going out of their way to help the ex-soldiers and sailors with arrangements for payment of tuition in monthly allotments , student loans , and help finding part-time work . Too Stringent ? Hardest for the Korean veteran to understand is why he is receiving less government help than did the GI of World War II . The GI of World War II finds $500  --  and in some cases more  --  for tuition paid directly to the school and also receives $75 ( more if he has dependents ) monthly . No money is paid directly to the college for the Korean  $110 monthly check . If he has one dependent , this is increased to $135 , if he has two or more , $160 . Among the veterans ' advisers at Boston area colleges , familiar with the faults of the older law , there is some feeling ex-servicemen have to make some financial effort for their education . However , more implied than voiced , there is a growing sentiment that the new law is a bit too stringent ."

Aid to small and medium business is as desirable an activity as government could embark upon . Undoubtedly , much of the thinking which went into the tax message was prompted by nonpolitical economic thinking .

The ? last two ? elections have demonstrated that Mr ' .",Truman enjoys the support of a. solid majority in the ranks of labor and among Negroes . ' His conr trilled interest in ' farm prices certainly has not injured his party among farmers .,"Now he offers comfort to small and ' medium.business .

But Boston and Westfield are hardly typical .","New Jersey education authorities , for example , estimate they could racially balance schools in 36 districts without new busing , but they could not do so in the 15 largest cities , where up to three-fourths of the state 's nonwhite schoolchildren live . The situation is similar in other densely populated states . <P> But this new busing would not necessarily mean the "" massive busing "" that most Americans assume integration would require ; increasing evidence demonstrates that it is needed only in rare cases . One study , by HEW 'S Office for Civil Rights , found that 19 districts operating in 1970-71 under court orders to integrate had to increase the number of pupils bused to school by only 9% .","<P> Another , financed by HEW and released after Nixon spoke , found that substantial integration-even in large cities like  busing would be necessary . That study , by the Lambda Corp. , a technical research firm in Arlington , Va. , assumed that no school-bus trip should take more than 35 minutes after the last child is picked up . The Lambda report also assumed that existing school-district lines would be retained , except in cities where a white majority in the city schools could be achieved only by exchanging students with nearby suburbs. * Even then , little new busing would be required . Researchers fed census figures , road maps , busing schedules and other data into a computer . They found , says Project Director George E. Pugh , that "" in most cases where the courts ordered desegregation , people put together plans that were highly inefficient , involving more busing than was necessary . """,empty,empty,empty
