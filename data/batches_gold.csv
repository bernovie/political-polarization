Not only does the new program pose a sharp threat to the perpetuation of much of foreign aid in its present form ; it calls for a completely new approach . Instead of handing over foreign-aid funds in lump sums to foreign governments to pass out as they wish , it now also becomes necessary to find worthy loan possibilities among private businessmen unable to get credit in their own countries or from U.S. banks . As a starter , the loan fund has $300 million available for this year for loans to promote private business . Applications are expected to total $950 million . Next year Congress has authorized $625 million more . By then applications may total as much as $1.5 billion .",empty,empty,empty,empty

He would have permanent authority to i earrange agencies subject only to disapproval by both houses of Congress within 60 days after the submission of a reorganization plan . Though it did not specifically exempt any agencies , it did require that separate plans be submitted far seven big ones . The Senate has received a bill but has not acted on it . It would give exemptions to none of the seven agencies mentioned under the House bill . Instead of giving the President permanent authority , it would end the matter April 1 , 1953 . Most important limitation on presidential authority under the Senate plan is that either House could kill a bill . ( The House bill specifies that a joint 1 . eto is necessary . ) The Hoox er "" task forces "" that blueprinted reorganization wrote almost 2,000.000 words . They studied 25 select problems , made 18 major reports . Their work has been called "" the most  . "" Branded a ' Mess ' Summarizing what they found in the hodgepodge of government agencies , the verdict expressed succinctly is "" a mess .

Sixty-five heads of agencies ai e required by law to report diectly to the President , a situation clearly impossible for , it he gave only an hour each week to each one , he would have no time left for matters of broad policy or affairs of state . Forty-five of the 60-odd top agencies of the executix e branch engage in operations affecting foreign policy and , due to lack of clear responsibility and integration , often step on each others ' toes or fail to winnow their information so the President gets pertinent facts . Typical Example In a typical case in Georgia , 47 employees attached to seven separate field services of the De , partment of Agriculture are operating in a cotton  in government is called vast . There ale 2.100,000 civilian employees , the budget reaches $42.000,000.000 , and taxes today take one dollar in five of the national income . The federal government has 1,812 separate departments , agencies , boards , and bureaus which have grown up in a hit-or-miss manner as Congress estab lished them or they broke off from other agencies by a process of fission . Every President since and including William H. Taft has been trying to get Congress to provide authority to weed this executive garden . The chances seem promising today , that is , provided Congress will act favorably and not make too many exemptions of favorite agencies . In his message to Congress , Mr. Truman praised former President Hoover highly , He emphasized that the reorganization program is "" a complicated and difficult task . "" No single bill passed by Congress will reorganize the government overnight , all sides point ou t Even if Mr. Truman should get the full authority which Mr. Hoover proposes ( Which is unlikely ) that would cover only part of the subject , and  Bureau in a tentative breakdown of Hoover recommendations concluded that 190 could be carried out by direct presidential order . Another 17 could be handled through appropriation bills . But 100 others v ould require supporting legislation from Congress .","Citizens Committee Thus , for closer consolidation of the three armed services under the Secretary of Defense . Mr. Truman could do much , but Congress itself would have to pass a law demoting the three service secretaries to be undersecretaries without the right of direct appeal to Mr. Truman . A Citizens . Committee for Reorganization of the Executive Branch of the Government has been set up in New York to help push the program . Its head is Dr. Robert L. Johnson .","president of Temple University . With him ale affiliated 1,000 prominent citizens , many of them connected with the Hoover task forces . The office is 15 West 46th Street . Branches are being established in major cities . One difficulty is that policy issues are involved in many decisions to merge or abolish agencies .","Should the post office deficit be wiped out , for  government subsidy to newspapers and magazines through low second-class postage rates . Another typical case is the objection of the Railway Labor Executives ' Association to any change being made in such agencies as the National Mediation Board , Railroad Adjustment Board and the like . Most government agencies think reorganization would be floc  --  for all but themselves . Nearly every agency has friends in Congress . That is why Congress never has been able to tackle the whole problem . There was too much logrolling by friends of one agency who combined with friends of another to block change .

Scheduled for announcement along with a forthcoming statement covering $300.000,000 of economic aid to Britain , the transaction was completed last week by the Economic Cooperation Administration . It was confirmed by the !","Mutual Security Agency after ' "" premature "" disclosure in London . The payment represents the dif- , ference , as of Nov. 30 , 1951 , be tween the amount of gold or dollars paid into the Payments Union on account of the deficit position of sterling in that agency and the amount that would have been paid had Britain not permitted the use of sterling balances held by other Marshall Plan countries in settling intra-European accounts through the Payments Union . Guarantee Won by Britain The guarantee arrangement was negotiated between Milton Katz , former United States special representative to Marshall Plan  State for Economic Affairs and subsequently Chancellor of the Exchequer . The agreement was signed June 7 , 1950 .","At that time the Organization for European Economic Cooperation , with some prodding from the E. C. A. , was trying to perfect a device for multilateral clearance of intra-European trade balances to take the place of the inter-European payments plan . The latter had been able to clear payments an a bilateral basis only . The United States , through the E. C. A. , was ready to put up a I working capital fund of $350,000 , - 000 to be drawn upon in the event that gold payments to creditor countries of the Payments Union exceeded gold receipts from debtor countries . However , - Britain demurred , fearing a-loss of gold and dollar reserves if member countries were permitted to apply : previously accumulated sterling balances to trade deficits . In the end , Britain was guaranteed against loss by the E. C. A. and Mr. Katz formalized this understanding in a letter to Mr. Gaitskell saying the United States Would "" indemnify the United Kingdom for  loss may have been caused by the use of sterling balances of net debtors in the settlement of their deficit with the European Payments Union . "" Britain 's Fears Justified With a basis thus provided for multilateral clearing of balances among all Marshall Plan countries , intra-European trade went ahead by leaps and bounds . But . Britain 's fears of the resulting losses in her ' reserves from use , of widely held ( sterling balances also proved well founded .","During the first year of the Payments Union 's operations , Britain realized a surplus in trade with other Countries in the Organization for European Economic Cooperation and received payment in gold from - the Payments Union . Since there was no drain on reserves , the E. C. A. paid no indemnity under the Katz-Gaitskell agreement . Last Summer , the trade balance of the United Kingdom with other participating countries changed from surplus to deficit and by Nov. 30 - this adverse balance with the Payments Union had reached $562,500,000 . After the previously accumulated surplus had been wiped out , the continued deficit required Britain to  as a result of October and November transactions . During the period of Payments Union operations , some other counltries had used $99,720,000 in accumulated sterling balances to I settle part of their accounts . Under ( the payment arrangements , this use of sterling balances had in creased the gold payments due from Britain to the Payments Union by $39,888,000 . U. S. Liability Continues . The guarantee agreement between the E. C. A. and Britain continues in effect until next June 30 and the United States will be liable for further payments if Britain finds it necessary to draw , further on her reserves . to keep ' current With the Payments Union . If , on the other hand , Britain should recover her surplus posit tion with other Payments member-countries , part of any.kOld she paid into the agency would be returned to the Mutual Security Agency . as successor to the ECA . Meanwhile , . the resumption of economic aid ""  - -  tet- Britain , ' which was I terminated a year ago , appeared to be blocked by official indecision as to how announcement of the  made . Originally it was planned to announce the grant before the arrival of Prime- Minister Churchill here this week , to avoid even the appearance of casting the British Government in the role of suppliant . More recently it has been suggested that - the announcement should follow Mr. Churchill 's departure from Washington . In any case , officials said today , only the finishing touches remained to be ; put on the use of $300,000,000 of transferable military aid funds for economic assistance to Britain to help keep up her rearmament program .",empty,empty

The Secretary of the Treasury will take some unpleasant , though familiar , news to President Eisenhower in Denver tomorrow .","George M. Humphrey probably will report that the Administration will be able next year to propose a worthwhile tax cut or a balanced budget , but not both . This report will be based on preliminary indications of spending in the next budget . These show that outlays will be little , if any , less ' than in the current fiscal year , which began July 1 . On the more cheerful side , Mr. Humphrey can report that the nation 's economy has shown no signs so far of being upset by the President 's illness , other than the stock-market shakedown .

The Secretary will fly to Denver with Sherman Adams , The Assistant to the President , who returned to Washington for the meeting . Vice President Richard M. Nixon presided at the Cabinet session . It was the third since the , President was stricken Sept. 24 with a moderate heart attack . The only Cabinet member absent was Postmaster General Arthur E. Summeffield . It is taken for granted that Congress will insist on some sort of tax cut in 1956 , a Presidential election year , although both Democrats and Republicans are said to be aware that it ? should not be too great . Another problem that Mr. Humphrey presumably will discuss with the President is the connection of tax reduction and the business situation . Assuming that spending can be reduced little if at all , as seems likely , about the only hope for any tax cut would arise from an economic boom . This would drive up receipts and allow a reduction  tax reduction bad economics , in the view of Administration econ // omists . They believe that it would stimulate further an already potentially inflationary situation . If the economy is not boomling and tax reduction becomes "" good economics , "" then such a , reduction would increase the deficit in a budget already in the red . The spending outlook is made up of three main factors : 1 . Defense spending will be about the same as this year . The Administration last year virtually guaranteed that no further major reductions in forces would be made . Several of its spokesmen said that the *34,000,000,000 level of spending probably would last for several years . 2 .

The Soviets , meantime , for their own reasons insist on sweeping disarmament agreements before there is effective international inspection and control to compel them to honor such agreements .

If the U.S. has bowed to pressure in this case , it is not so much that of IMrushchev or Macmillan as of the sOorld 's longing for peace . Practicality , at any rate , must govern the approach to the summit . We should not assume there will be any agreement . Even more important , we should not feel that getting an agreement is the overriding consideration . As the background of Berlin itself shows , a bad agreement with the Soviets can be far worse than no agreement at all .",empty,empty,empty
