The decision could have some impact on the forthcoming civil rights debate in the Senate . The bill as passed by the House declares void all segregation provisions of Federal law , such as the Hill-Burton proviso . And it orders agencies giving direct aid to end segregation in the programs . This case could be said to accomplish part of the objective  . It would have far less sweeping effects than a general Congressional command to end discrimination in Federally aided projects .",empty,1964.0

Most businessmen have generally regarded reciprocity as normal and inevitable . The securities industry , for example , which recently has been attacked by the Securities and Exchange Commission for some of its traditional , formalized reciprocity arrangements , has publicly defended itself , in part by arguing that reciprocity is // standard business practice .
