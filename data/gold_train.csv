style='color: blue'>spending</span> brutally , or countenance rapid <span class='dim_f' style='color: blue'>inflation</span> .<br>2.- That is the hard conclusion of a major new study of <span

increases built into current <span class='both' style='color: green'>federal</span> <span class='both' style='color: green'>programs</span> and those the <span class='both' style='color:

Release of the study last week immediately sharpened a basic campaign debate over the issues of how much social service Americans should expect from the Federal Government and how heavily they should be taxed to pay the bills . <P> At present tax rates , concluded a team of Brookings economists headed by former Budget Bureau Director Charles Schultze , the future spending increases built into current federal programs and those the Administration proposes now will lead to a budget deficit of $17 billion by fiscal 1975 . That will occur even if the economy is by then operating at full employment , which is usually defined as a jobless rate no higher than 4% .","Large deficits can be tolerated when there is substantial slack in the economy ,  be grossly inflationary . Not until fiscal 1977 , the Brookings scholars believe , will economic growth bring in enough tax revenue to yield a budget surplus of a relatively small $5 billion . Even that calculation assumes that the Government will start not a single new major spending program for the next four years . All by itself , however , the proposed 20% increase in Social Security benefits now being talked up in Congress could more than wipe out any potential surplus . <P> Though the report was prepared by mostly Democratic economists , the Nixon Administration voiced no disagreement with their mathematics . But it strongly disputed their policy conclusions .","White House policymakers seized on the chance to make clear their choice among the available options . At a press conference called to rebut the Brookings study , Presidential Assistant John Ehrlichman painted this picture of Nixon 's policy during a potential second term : taxes will be held down , federal social spending will be slashed deeply , and the financial burden of many programs will in effect be shifted to states and cities . <P>  increases in federal taxation for the foreseeable future .

Yet , with the Federal Government taking 75 cents of every tax dollar , it is obvious where economies must be made if they are to return any substantial benefit to the taxpayer . The problem of overlapping taxes will  scale , with Washington , the states and cities sitting down together . President Truman brought to the Mayors ' conference the good news that the Secretary of the Treasury will soon invite state and city officials to I meet with him and other federal officials to devise a program to "" bring ' some order out of the tangle "" in the field of ? taxation and financial relations . This will not be easy . The Federal Government has reached more and more into the local field ; meanwhile twdthirds of the states have taken up the income . tax , and cities are increasingly adopting it or the payroll tax .","The Federal Government has not set a good example to the states , either in multiplicity of taxation or economy of operation . As a result , to a certain extent , I states and cities have unfairly become the whipping boys of the public because of federal extravagance . The taxpayer will feel more liberally disposed to his state and city governments when the costliness of the federal establishment is reduced .",empty,empty,empty,1949

' . The tax program has its technical rationale . That already has been provided by the report of the President 's economic advisers and the State of the Union message . The rationale is that government fiscal policy  --  Lboth budget .","and taxes ? is a powerful instrument which can be used to stabilize and expand the economy of the United States ; that it should now be used to encourage a higher level of business activity , ' and that acceptance of an unbalanced budget for the time being is a desirable means toward achieving higher prosperity later . AA A The tax message recognizes the politically obvious fact that the Truman administration has few votes to win among oil well owners , big stockholders in big corporations , people who would suffer from estate and ' gift taxes , ? and  gains taxes . Such people , so far as the Truman administration is concerned , are not only politically expendable=they never existedamong the ranks of potential Truman ' supporters . On the other hand , the tax message offers very considerable - prospective benefits to small business and small-business men . The proposed ' relief from wartime excise taxes could mean a big boost in business to hundreds of thousands of retail merchants  --  the men who sell jewelry , luggage , furs , and cosmetics . Considering that one or more of these items are to be found in just about every form of retail establishment the land over , from the corner drugstore to the biggest big city department store , the tax message might win some new friends for Mr. Truman . A A It is not quite accurate to suggest that only small busi : ness would benefit from the tax cuts Mr. Truman proposes . Railroads and bus and'air lines would b'e relieved of the transportation tax . The ' telephone companies and Western Union also ' could sell their services minus the tax , which in  , these are all . big operations .","But here it seems probable that Mr .. Truman 's advisers are more interested in lower costs to the consumer than any possibility that the members of the Railroad Executives Association might turn into Fair Dealers . Making allowance for that last factor , proposed tax relief to railroads and telephone andtelegraph companiq , the mes. ! sage is definitely an incentive program for the benefit of small and medium business . A A A Now , it would not be fair - to imply that this is done solely to seek votes in this economic bracket of the population ; nor do I mean to make ' that implication .","Small business is a major foundation of American enterprise and prosperity . Aid to small and medium business is as desirable an activity as government could embark upon . Undoubtedly , much of the thinking which went into the tax message was prompted by nonpolitical economic thinking . Yet the fact remains that a tax message which offers aid and comfort to small . and medium business rounds out a political formula :  hard to beat . The ? last two ? elections have demonstrated that Mr ' .",Truman enjoys the support of a. solid majority in the ranks of labor and among Negroes . ' His conr trilled interest in ' farm prices certainly has not injured his party among farmers .,"Now he offers comfort to small and ' medium.business . Whether this is intentionally or accidentally political is for each to decide according to his personal views . But whatever the motive , the end result is something Republicans will have to wrestle with foi some time to eome.",

At the same time both David L. Cole , chairman of the President 's board , and Cyrus S. Ching , director of the Federal Mediation Service , will be on hand to offer the ' participants their services . Mr. Ching and Mr. Cole will also keep President Truman informed on the progress of the negotiations . ? Mr. Cole arrived in Washington tonight and said that he hoped the conference tomorrow would lead to a contract that would end the prolonged coal dispute . His own plans , he explained , were "" flexible . ""","He indicated that they would depend largely on the developments here in the next day or two .

Senator George is not opposed to the principle of taxing away windfall war profits ( nor , for that matter , are many other people ) , but he pointed out that the proposed amendment , though it  not a true wartime excess profits tax at all . He would , he said , support an excess profits tax , but only if it was "" one that he could honestly defend "" and only after the people who would have to pay the tax had been given an opportunity to be heard . Senator George then proceeded to give incontestable earnest of his and his associates ' good faith in the matter . He agreed to an amendment which directed the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee to bring out excess profits legislation at the next session of Congress ( when the second defense revenue bill is scheduled for action ) and ' to make that tax retroactive to Oct. 1 , this year . That certainly should have been all the assurance that any reasonable person could have wished , and the Senate did , indeed , accept it as such , by voting its approval of the bill . Now it appears , however , that certain members of the House still believe they can squeeze a few drops of political nutriment  of meeting the cost of the defense program by "" soaking the profiteers . "" Although President Truman has flatly stated that action on the highly controversial excess profits tax should be put over until 1951 , and although the pending bill , as noted above , carries a directive providing for such a tax on a retroactive basis , Representative Eberharter of Pennsylvania has just let it be known that he means to block immediate House action on the $4,508 , - 000,000 bill . As we have pointed out before , there is no issue here of whether our corporations or anyone else is to be permitted to turn a potential war emergency to his material advantage . Everyone is going to have to pitch in , so far as taxes are . concerned , if the present defense effort is to be put on a pay-as-you-go basis . The established , and sensible , practice is for Congress to *vote ; without unnecessary ?","delay , a general increase in existing taxes . That is exactly what the pending "" interim "" measure does , raising taxes on  consideration of other possible sources of emergency revenue . ' Arguments that it is necessary to attach an excess profits tax to the pending bill to prevent "" inflation "" and "" profiteering "" are purely political . In the first place , corporations do n't have to raise prices to profit from a boom , whether it is a peacetime or a war phenomenon . The era of the nation 's greatest corporate prosperity , in the Twenties , was a period of steadily falling prices . ( The post-World War I boom of 1919-20 occurred , incidentally , at a time when an excess profits tax was atillin force . ) In the second place corporations that . wished to ' raise prices would not be likely to be seriously deterred by the .","consideration that this might involve a tax payment at some time in the future . Furthermore , since the economy has not yet felt the impact of . the post-Korean rearmament program , there can hardly be any profits directly attributable to the war in the immediate future . And , finally , the legislation  first of next month on will be covered by the excess profits provision of the second ( 1951 ) defense revenue bill .","We are as intolerant as anyone when it comes to wartime profiteering ; in fact , in one respect we are perhaps more intolerant than some . We object to wartime profiteering of any kind , even when it takes the form of political profiteering .",empty,1950

Larger expenditures would come only later , if and when the equipment has been developed satisfactorily . Therefore the report that expenditure in this field is to be limited to one billion dollars does not necessarily mean that full-scale continental defense has been turned down .

Evidence of this is a group of 100 Korean war veterans . at Boston University who organized last night to ask for more money . The government allotment ? as well as other factors ?,is apparently causing a smaller pro .. portion of veterans to head back to school than after World War II . A national news magazine has reported that one in ten Korean war veterans is now in school  --  while more than half the World War II GIs used their education benefits at the peak of their enrollment . This raises the question whether it would be in the national interest to increase veterans ' allotments . Many veterans besides the BU group are hoping congressional action in their behalf will be taken .,"Major Test Still Ahead However , Veterans Administration officials in Washington say it is too early to make enrollment comparisons with World War II veterans . The peak of the  Despite some flaws , the law is operating with "" reasonable general satisfaction , "" in the opinion of Dr. James L. McCaskill , coordinator of the Na tional Conference for the Mobilization of Education . This fall 7,000 of the 61,000 Korean war veterans in Massachusetts are enrolled in college . There are 1,000 Korean war veterans at Boston University , 625 at Harvard , fewer than 50 at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , and about 50 at Tufts .","Without assistance , only those who go to state universities , or who live at home and attend neighborhood schools , seem likely to get through the year on $990 . That is about what the returning soldier or sailor with no dependents can expect to finance a year 's schooling and living expenses . It is paid in installments of $110 during the school year . Cost Dwarfs Allotment Meanwhile minimum expenses at many universities have gone up this fall , A year at a top-ranking eastern college like Harvard , Yale , or the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is expected to cost about $1,800 . This includes  , room , clothes , and books , with very few extras .","Tuition at state universities is much lower ? $200 at the University of Massachusetts . The United States Office of Education is carrying on a nationwide study now to see whether the lower government allotment is causing an abnormally large proportion to seek out low-tuition schools . At many large universities , such as Boston University , tuition ranges between $500 and $600 .","Extra fees may add up to $50 . Most colleges are going out of their way to help the ex-soldiers and sailors with arrangements for payment of tuition in monthly allotments , student loans , and help finding part-time work . Too Stringent ? Hardest for the Korean veteran to understand is why he is receiving less government help than did the GI of World War II . The GI of World War II finds $500  --  and in some cases more  --  for tuition paid directly to the school and also receives $75 ( more if he has dependents ) monthly . No money is paid directly to the college for the Korean  $110 monthly check . If he has one dependent , this is increased to $135 , if he has two or more , $160 . Among the veterans ' advisers at Boston area colleges , familiar with the faults of the older law , there is some feeling ex-servicemen have to make some financial effort for their education . However , more implied than voiced , there is a growing sentiment that the new law is a bit too stringent .",

In a letter to Premier Bulganin , which resumes the correspondence between them on this subject , he calls on the Soviets to join the free world in a new and realistic approach to the problem in order to provide some kind of alarm system that would guard against surprise attack and then to bring under control the threat of atomic war . This new approach was endorsed by the United Nations last December when the General Assembly approved by the overwhelming vote of 56 to 7 a resolution giving priority in future disarmament discussions to President Eisenhower 's "" open skies "" plan for aerial reconnaissance and exchange of military blueprints , in combination with the Soviet plan for ground-control posts .

The President now appeals to the Soviets to make good their words about the desirability of mutual safeguards by dropping their opposition to this combination of their own plan with the American plan and to cooperate in making both proposals effective . This , he declares , is the surest way to an effectively controlled disarmament , to an easing of international tensions and to a durable peace . Furthermore , to meet some of their objections , he assures the Soviets that this warning system would not be limited to the United States and Soviet Russia but would apply to other nations , and , brushing aside the Soviet claim that they no longer have any foreign bases , he agrees in particular to extend this system to the "" forces and facilities which we both have outside our borders . "" Finally , in keeping with the United Nations resolution , he calls on the Soviets to join other nations in working out suitable and safeguarded arrangements for ending the stockpiling of atomic weapons and making  the projected international "" atomsfor-peace "" agency .

Since it is generally admitted thus far that effective control in this ? field is more than dubious it is possible that the American delegation may make new proposals on this  the President 's latest letter , however , is that effective inspection and control are the first essential conditions for any disarmament , and that without these two essentials disarmament would be only a snare and a delusion .

There is doubt that more than one has been fired . There are no rockets in full-scale production .","There have been accomplishments , but Moscow does not deserve the world-wide excitement its , announcement caused . We , too , have missile accomplishments .","A year ago the Army 's Jupiter C  --  a test vehicle without guidance  --  flew about 3,600 miles , the longest distance flown alp to that time by a ballistic mis- ; sile . This was a creditable performance , though it was hidden under a veil of stupid and Unnecessary secrecy . The firing leaked out slowly in technical magazines ; our allies  it at a press conference . Our Government knew , too , of the Russian test long before Moscow announced it . Again , Washington might have taken some of the steam from the Soviet propaganda had we announced the Soviet test  --  as we have done intermittently in the case of Russian nuclear tests instead of permitting Moscow a "" time and place and impact of its own choosing . "" There are some serious , lessons to be learned in Washington from the Moscow announcement . If we take them to heart we need have no great cause for future worry .","But if we do .. not , we face more nightmare "" surprises . """,1957

"" First Club Appearance This was Mr. Eisenhower 's first appearance as President at a luncheon of the Natonal Press club , which has been a forum for many prominent Americans and foreigners . The Wednesday session differed f rom , the President 's regular news conferences , in that written questions were submitted , and John V. Horner , club president , selected those to be put to Mr. Eisenhower . At his regular news conferences reporters ask questions orally without advance notice .","The questions and answers at the luncheon ranged from broad fiscal and foreign policy to Gen. Eisenhower 's World War II days . Replies to Questions In his replies the President : 1 . Said he could not  nomination a n y aspirant who did not go along with his own basic political philosophy . He added , however , that he could write out a list of up to a dozen "" fine , virile "" Republicans whom he would gladly support for the nomination .","He named no names . 2 . Laughed off a suggestion that he had shifted from "" modern Republicanism toward traditional Republican conservatism . ""","The President said he is trying , as he has for the last six years , to apply Republican principles to modem problems . Need More than Laws 3 . Called for giving the federal government more power to protect voting rights of Negroes , but said , as he has before , that the school integration problem can not be solved just by laws . He called school closing to thwart integration a "" tragic "" move that can not be corrected by the federal government alone . 4 . Said that , "" contrary "" to what he has read in some papers , he likes to hold news conferences but that he objects to  , such as once a week . Last year he averaged less than one news conference every two weeks . 5 . Defended his World War II generalship , which has been criticized by British Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery among others .","Mr. Eisenhower said he believes it is "" not profitable "" to second-guess in siich cases , adding that "" we did win the war . "" Churchill Great Man In reminiscing about the war the President called Winston Churchill one of history 's truly "" great men . "" He said he probably had more "" warm arguments "" with the former British prime minister than anyone in the allied forces , "" because I happened to be of a nationality that he could not shut up if he wanted to .

The President has been employing every possible occasion to demonstrate a determination , which has finally impressed even the speculators in gold , to protect the dollar from further debasement . For example , he told his second news conference that "" With every new spending program we send * * * we will suggest a source of revenue for it . "" And this policy is generally accepted as one of the strongest safeguards against all forms of inflation . The President and most of his influential ? economic advisers seem to place reliance on a source of this revenue that is theoretical as contrasted with such solid sources as those additional taxes the ? traffic will bear . This theory is that certain kinds of extra spending will stimulate the economy  --  among other stimulations , reducing unemployment  --  thus producing new revenue for the treasury . Such spending , known as pump-priming , failed to attain these objectives during the New Deal , despite the billions it consumed . So until it is clear how much President Kennedy will  , there can be no measure of the ability of this method to contribute to the revenue required to effect the President 's policy of balancing Federal outgo with Federal income . There is , however , a demonstrable check against waste and inflationary spending that the President has not mentioned in his messages and statements thus far . It has been sought by and for Presidents ever since 1876 , and as steadily denied by Congress , although most of the states have granted it to their Governors .","This is the so-called "" item veto "" power whereby the President can refuse to approve certain appropriations in a Federal supply bill without disapproving the entire measure . President Eisenhower requested this power from Congress more often than any of his predecessors , but with no more success . Even though Congress has given this authority to Governors of our territories and insular possessions , and in extending it by statute to Presidents would retain the same power to override an item veto that it has to repass an entire measure , dissenters to the request have easily prevailed on  expand the President 's power . For the same political reasons he could use it to strike out state and local appropriations to punish members of Congress and communities , and retain others with less justification .","The "" pork "" in appropriation bills ? the financing of pet , extravagant and other wholly unnecessary projects  --  would not be removed ; it would simply be weighed and allocated at the White House instead of at the Capitol . As a constitutional amendment , the plan would be out of harmony with the Constitution , which restricts to Congress the power of the purse . As a statute RI would be unconstitutional . The Stone Wall in Congress In a study made for Speaker Bankhead in 1937 , Representative Hatton Sumners , a most respected ( legislator , concluded that these objections would be met if the Presidential item veto were restricted in advance by Congress to certain specified items in specified bills . But Congress was as hostile to this proposal , by which all its power was retained , as to the plea for a full grant of the  a year before . In one of the strongest arguments since the matter was laid before Congress and the people by President Grant , Vandenberg said : - It does not give the Presi- , dent one single additional affirmative power . He can not start anything as a result .","He can only stop something long enough to focus the attention of the country on it , and long enough to force two-thirds of the House and Senate to agree to it the vetoed item in spite of him and his reasons , if they should persist in their adverse judgments . Its only harm , if any , would lie in the temporary delay while Congress and the country stop , look and listen . * * * Without ' this item veto the budget * * can become a * * * wooden gun . If President Kennedy could get this authority he would have a most effective , immediate and self-evident means of regularly balancing spending and revenue . And , though Congress once more might decline , he will never know if he does n't make  this to rally public opinion behind it .",empty,empty,1961

It should seek to unite rather than divide men and women of goodwill throughout the country . Its program should be positive , rather than negative .","It should recognize the problems that have to be solved by governmental action , and outline its views on how solutions can be worked out . The new conservatism should nail down its right wing , abandoning the extremist fringe , and then spread its effort at consensus as far into the center as possible . This is the mood of the United States today . * Leaving world problems aside , the great need domestically is still that of adjustment to and utilization of the tremendous technologi. cal revolution through which we are moving .","The tax cut has sufficiently stimulated aggregate demand for goods so as to conceal for a time the problems inherent in the industrial system 's vastly increased productive efficiency . Population explosion and technological progress ( automation ) are running far ahead of economic growth  mean there is n't enough work to go around . There is a great deal of work to be done , in the United States alone .","But it is work which falls partly in the public sector and partly in the private . It is work such as the replanning of our urban and suburban areas , and rebuilding large parts of them . It is work such as will provide better education and technical job training for those who have hitherto been unskilled laborers . There is very little need for unskilled labor any more .","The new conservatism should ask : How can the public and private sectors of the economy best be coordinated , so that the strengths of each will be maximized ? What obstacles are there to the fuller expansion and imaginative growth of the private sector ? Do antiquated fetters , such as impede building construction , need to be removed ? Do labor 's many restrictions need to be reexamined , so as to promote job creation in the interest of labor ? In short , the new conservatism could turn to economic  of national solutions in the rest of the 1960's.",1964

The war in Vietnam is fast proving the superiority of nuclear-powered warships . The carrier Enterprise , frigate Bainbridge , and cruiser Long Beach have awed Pentagon officials and congressmen with their capacity for sustained action . As a result , Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara is running into stiffer opposition in Congress . He has been trying to save money by building conventionally powered naval escort ships .","But he is slowly losing on the nuclear scoreboard . The carrier John F. Kennedy , soon to join the fleet , is due to be the last conventionally powered carrier . In answer to McNamara arguments that nuclear craft cost about two-thirds again as much , Navy opponents point out that the additional cost includes fuel for about 10 years . Performance of nuclear ships off Vietnam , plus arguments on costs and operational advantages , are expected to have their effect . Result : A nuclear United States Navy much sooner than anticipated .",reproduced with permission of the copyright owner . Further reproduction,1967

As the time approached for the nation 's more than six million college students to return to the campuses ? starting this week  --  for the 1969-70 school year , one could obtain within the Federal Government at least three widely varying opinions about how much turmoil to expect . Late in August , very high officials within the Administration , who asked not to be identified , said they believed that student militancy had declined since the violent outbreaks of last spring and that campuses this fall would be relatively quiet . They based their belief on conversations with university officials . Later , J.

Criticizing Government The Congressmen are publicly expressing their displeasure with the Administration of their own party for not acting on the recommendations they made following their campus tour . While praising Government officials for opposing the enactment of repressive legislation against disorders , they say the Nixon Administration has not taken the positive steps needed  --  for example , the creation of a Presidential Commission on Higher Education to oversee the administration of all youth programs . Beyond administrative steps . Representative Riegle pointed out that neither the Administration nor Congress has moved meaningfully in the  rise to the student unrest in the first place . Mr. Riegle believes that a substantial withdrawal of troops from Vietnam in August would have done much to cool the campuses . Instead , some students are planning further antiwar protests and a general strike in October .","Congress has done nothing about the Administration 's proposals to reform the military draft . And whenever Vice President Agnew talks of going to Mars , the militant stn. dents are reminded of what they consider disordered priorities , with social needs suffering at the expense of space and the military . In Mr. Riegle 's opinion , the Government has not responded as it should because the predominant view both within the Administration and in Congress is that the campus disorders are a passing phase , the-work of a small minority , and can be contained . The Michigan legislator and others believe this view to be "" dead wrong , "" that large numbers of the most , able and articulate students are determined to take the country down a "" different road .

But the barest fact that deep divisions exist within the Government over the nature of the student revolt ? reflecting the same divisions in the society ?",was a strong indication that the nation could draw no assurance that the worst of the campus unrest was over . - J01- 11T HEREE'llS             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @,empty,

For example , it was estimated that under the bill it would receive $229-million from the  it , as compared to $85-million appropriated for reforestation and forest management this year . The Forest Service would welcome the extra money because it is already 5 million acres behind in reforestation of cut-over lands . On the other hand , the service was quite aware that the President might not request and the Congress might not appropriate all the money annually deposited in the fund . And under the bill the unused funds would be transferred to the Treasury if not used within two years . Because of the bill 's injunction to develop "" optimum "" productivity , the forest service realized it would be under intense industry pressure to allow increased cutting even if it did not receive all the money in the fund for reforestation .

Even though the program will be part of the N.I.H. , the budget will not go first to the institutes ' director nor to its parent organization . The Department of Health , Education and Welfare . These points had not been entirely clear in the Administration bill , Mr. Richardson also indicated that the director of the cancer program , a Presidential appointee , would have rank equal to the director of the N.I.H. and would be given the opportunity "" to review and comment on the program plans and budget request for cancer-related activities of the other N.I.H. institutes and research divisions . "" Answering questions from reporters after the hearing , Senator Kennedy  the subcommittee would be very close to a revised version of the Administration bill . He said there had been consultation between his subcommittee and the Administration on the revisions . Some Voices of Dissent Dissents at the hearing were ! voiced by Senator Gaylord Nelson , Democrat of Wisconsin , and Dr. John A. D. Cooper , president of the Association of American Medical Colleges Senator Nelson said it appeared that the cancer agency would physically be at the N , I , H. , but administratively and ' philosophically would constitue a separate agency and that this separation would have an ill effect on the institutes as a whole and on biomedical research in general . Dr. Cooper said his association looked with concern on legislative efforts , however well-intentioned , that would isolate a special conquest of cancer program in a new agency outside the National Institutes of Health . All who spoke today emphasized that the cancer problem was multifaceted and extremely difficult and that no one should expect a quick or easy solution . But Dr. Cooper said the association , representing an important element of  dark undercurrents of opinion "" that , he said , had entered the national debate on the conquest of cancer ? One of these is that the mere injection of Federal funds will somehow produce "" an instant cure for cancer . "" The other , he said , is the view that the key problem in current cancer research is managerial rather than scientific . He called both of these ideas "" unconscionable. """,empty,empty,empty,1971

And for the first time in history , federal income security payments  --  basically Social Security , public assistance and services , and other retirement and social insurance programs ? will exceed $100 billion .

And in Moscow last week , Nikita Khrushchev told a press conference that "" if the Americans put forth any kind of discriminatory condition to the sale of wheat , then we will not buy wheat in America . "" <P> U.S. officials are confident that some thing can be worked out . For one thing , foreign shipping rates have been rising since the Communists began preempting cargo space for Western wheat . For another , the 400-odd U.S. merchant vessels capable of carrying grain may be nearly all booked up anyway when the Russia-bound wheat is ready to move .

petty and personal as it may seem , the clash between President Nixon and Labor Chieftain George Meany is for the highest political stakes . At issue is not only the fate of Nixon 's plan for the nation 's economic recovery , which may depend on whether labor accepts the Government 's wage guidelines . Also in the balance is the 1972 presidential election . Determined that Nixon must go , Meany is preparing the biggest labor participation of any campaign in history .","Just as determined to stay , Nixon plans to beat back the attack by showing that he serves the national interest while labor serves only itself. * <P> The battle opened head-on at the A.F.L.-C.I.O. convention in Bal Harbour , Fla . A week after the encounter , pundits were still busy retracing the maneuverings of these two seasoned infighters . The President staged the first surprise . Though he had been routinely invited to attend two months before , he did not accept until the eve of the convention two weeks ago . George Shultz called Meany to ask if Nixon  replied the labor boss . The executive council had scheduled a meeting to vote on a resolution of noncooperation with the Pay Board . Nixon would have to come later . <P> No Flourishes . A swarm of presidential advancemen descended . They made a number of requests of Meany : an offstage microphone for announcing the President 's arrival , a union band to strike up Ruffles and Flourishes and Hail to the Chief , a seat of honor to the right of the podium for the President to occupy while Meany made the introduction , removal of delegate seats in front of the speakers ' stand to make room for live television cameras , banishment from the press area of reporters covering the convention so that there would be space for White House correspondents . <P> Meany flatly turned down all the requests . The White House persisted about the music . The Secret Service brought along sheet music and placed it on the musicians ' stands . Meany told the Musicians ' Union not to let the orchestra play . Hissed a Nixon man : "" You will  musicians lay down their instruments . <P> When the President emerged , he was accompanied by no music , and received only perfunctory applause from the delegates . Since he could not get the seat he felt the dignity of his office required , he walked directly to the podium .

This dramatic statement closed a long and conclusive rebuttal to Soviet charges that the United States had looted patents and gold in Germany . Stripped of its diplomatic verbiage , of which there was precious little , General Marshall 's statement said that Foreign Minister Molotov had his facts wrong . Yesterday the Soviet Foreign Minister released the hitherto secret protocol on reparations that was signed at the Yalta conference . Today General Marshall emphatically presented the United States view that the Yalta provisions had been superseded by the reparations agreements at the Potsdam conference . In the Yalta protocol , as released by Mr. Molotov , the Big Three powers agreed to deliveries from German current production as one form of reparal tions . The Potsdam Declaration neither provides for nor bans such deliveries ; it says  used "" in the first place "" to pay for imports . Soviet Obtaining Patents In answering the Soviet charge concerning patents , Secretary Marshall said that Amtorg , the Soviet trading corporation , had bought at a nominal price the largest portion of the pamphlets on German patents released by the United States Department of Commerce . Mr. Molotov had charged that these patents , together with gold and other things seized by the United States and Britain in their I zones , amounted to reparations worth more than $10,000,000,000 . This Secretary Marshall strongly denied . Then , taking the offensive , the Secretary of State quoted a letter from John C. Green of the Department of Commerce asking that the United States receive access to scientific and technological information that the Russians had taken from their zone of occupation . This access was requested on terms similar to those whereby the Russians are acquiring a mass of material from the United States . A veteran spectator at Big Four meetings said later that he had rarely seen Mr. Molotov so shaken as he appeared to be at the  in a calm , matter-of-fact tone that made it all the more effective . British Position Backed This Russo-American exchange followed an earlier oral duel between Mr. Molotov and Foreign Secretary Bevin of Britain . Mr. Bevin defended the British position on patents and said that "" it is so easy to make misleading statements . "" Earlier in the sessior Foreign Minister Bidault of France had presented a paper in which France refused to consider a change in the German level of industry , called for strict limitation of German coal consumption and steel production and backed the principles of the United States proposal for a four-power , Iong-term treaty to insure German disarmament . M. Bidault 's visit to Premier Stalin last night apparently has not affected French ideas on the economic treatment of Germany . Whereas the Russians yesterday plumped for a higher level of industry in Germany , the French Foreign Minister declared today that France considered that Germany 's steel-making capacity , on which the level of industry is based , should stay where it is7,500,000 tons a year . M. Bidault also opposed the organization  proposed yesterday , so long as the frontiers of Germany were not fixed . The Frenchman threw into his speech a suggestion that in the future German coal be moved to France to make steel of French iron instead of France 's "" sending our iron to Germany so the Germans can make steel out of it . "" Secretary Marshall 's statement today was by all odds the most effective answer that any of the three Western powers had yet ! made to the extravagant charges on Germany by Mr. Molotov , Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Andrei Y. Vishinsky and the Soviet press . The basis of his final words was Russia 's statement , made yesterday , that Russian reparations claims of $10,000,000,000 had been agreed upon at tht Yalta conference by the United States delegation . President Truman 's speech of Aug. 9 , 1945 , clearly stated the United States ' understanding that the Yalta provisions on reparations were superseded by the Potsdam decisions , Secretary Marshall said . The figure of $20,000,000,000 in reparations , one-half of which was to go to Russia , was discussed  dropped at Potsdam , the Secretary continued . The reason for this , he explained patiently , was that - at Potsdam it was agreed that the idea of fixing a dollar value on the reparations shares of each nation would be the sort of guarantee that might be impossible to fulfill . General Marshall recalled that Mr. Molotov raised in Paris in July , 1946 , the same supposed Yalta agreemen . James F.

The Secretary emphasized , as Mr. Bevin had earlier , that the Western powers were not making any money out of Germany , but were , on the contrary , pouring money and material into their zones . He also said that the United States had not accepted ownership of captured German gold , as Mr. Molotov had charged , and it was pointed out that Hungarian gold seized by the Germans already had been returned to Hungary . Secretary Marshall 's tone throughout this section of the session was that of a patient instructor with a small boy  exchange on reparations between Mr. Molotov and Mr. Bevin there was perhaps one positive achievement . This was an agreement between the Briton and the Russian to produce figures on reparations from their respective zones . The Soviet figures , when they appear , will be the first Russia has made public .

The House gave its approval by 220 to 99 today to the bill reducing personal income taxes by 10.5 to 30 per cent , starting July 1 .

Speculation in Congress continued to lean toward disapproval by the White House . In such an event , it was conceded almost generally , a veto would stand . Republican leaders repeated that if this effort for tax slashes failed there would be no further attempts this year . Representative Harold Knutson , chairman of the Ways and Means Committee , said after the vote : "" Tax reduction is now up to the President , as far as the House is concerned .

Opposing were ninetyseven Democrats , Vito Marcantonio , American Labor member of New York , and Mr. Hull . The measure , however , faces a different situation in the Senate . On May 28 , when the Upper House passed the bill in the form in which , with little change , it survived the conference , the vote was 52 to 34 . It lacked five votes of providing a two-thirds majority . Since then , influential Democrats who supported the original measure , such as Senator Walter F. George of Georgia , former Finance Committee chairman , have indicated that they would not , however , vote to override a . Presidential veto if it came . The measure provides for tax reductions , starting July 1 , as follows : For persons with annual taxable income  --  that is , after exemptions and deductions , of $1,000 or less , the cut would be by 30 per cent . This reduction would apply , as examples , to unmarried persons with total earnings , before  . It would apply also to married persons without children with an annual gross of $2,222 . Included also would be married couples with one child and a gross income up to $2,777 , or with two children and a gross of up to $3,333 . For persons with a taxable income ranging between $1,000 and around $1,400 , following the factors given above , there would be a fiat tax reduction of $67 , or a 20 per cent slash in tax payment , whichever is more . For persons in income brackets between $1,400 and $137,000 the 20 per cent cut is provided . For those in the $137,000 to $302,000 range a cut of 15 per cent would prevail . On any income above $302,000 the reduction would be at 10.5 per cent . The present ceiling of 85.5 per cent at which any income , no matter how great , could be taxed , would be reduced in the pending legislation to 81 per cent this year and to 76.5 per cent in 1948 . Persons who have passed the age of 65 would have an additional  $1,000 . In final House debate today ( a veto vote is taken without debate ) two Democratic members of the Ways and Means Committee , Representatives John J. Dingell of Michigan and Herman P. Eberharter of Pennsylvania , urged the President to veto the bill .","The House also heard Mr. Doughton , who was chairman of the committee through many New Deal years , call for its acceptance at the White House .

The credit is fast being used with no sign that it is fulfilling its intended purpose of getting Britain 's war-ravaged economy back on its feet . Moreover , England must now ado to her other burdens some important financial commitments under the loan for which a one-yea r deadline was set last July . This has been the subject of intensive secret negotiations in Washington the past week . The British held they could not comply with some details of the loan agreement .

Time and again during the past few months , high-ranking British officials were led up to the Idea of another loan request by aids who sought to nerve the Attlee regime for the jump . Both . Foreign Secretary Bevin and Chancellor of the Exchequer Hugh Denton were horrified at the prospect , But they had begun to face it somewhat unsteadily when Secretary Marshall made his June 4 speech at Harvard . The Marshall address was all that Mr. Bevin needed to turn sharply away again from the notion of another direct loan from the United States . He embraced the Marshall suggestions eagerly and has not since been  all Britain 's hopes for relief when the loan money runs out center in the cooperative European and American recovery effort . The Attlee government is understood to have no alternative plan involving additional American help in case the Marshall plan should fall through . Whether the Marshall proposal will put enough American dollars within Britain 's reach when the loan is exhausted remains an unanswered question . But the British apparently are putting their eggs in that basket , taking the view that if dollars are spent on European recovery a gocid par of them must eventually be corralled by British trade .

England must offer those who sell her goods payment In whatever currency they demand . 2 . British dominions and other countries in the so-called sterling area are now permitted to spend any future sterling credits they may acquire wherever they desire . Previously their spending of such credits was limited to the sterling area . 3 .

He said it would not be enough to develop an air arm to drop the bomb on an enemy but the Navy and Army must also be built up to make a team of this country 's fighting forces . Mr. Dewey reiterated his advoConlinued on Page  of a United States of Europe and said that all the sacrifices the American people had made for aid to Europe would become worth while if Western Europe were made into one large area for the free exchange of goods and services . Asserting that "" some individuals and nations in Europe "" were resisting the economic unity necessary for survival of Western Europe , he declared : "" We have made enormous sacrifices in the cause of peace . We are entitled to know that no doctrinaire group can sacrifice the peace either to pet projects of socialism or nationalism . "" Urging Senatorial ratification of the North Atlantic Treaty , Mr. Dewey said that the pact and "" our own Congressional enactments "" called for progress towards European economic unity , as well as mutual defense , and implied a "" clear necessity for a free and developing Africa . "" If Africa were abandoned to the Communists , whom Governor Dewey described as "" waking there very busily right now , "" the free world would lose a source of raw materials without which it could not survive  ratifies that Atlantic Treaty "" with real enthusiasm "" it would appear , he said , that this country was "" starting all over again down the same road we followed after World War I which led to World War II . "" He said that the Soviet Union was continuing relentlessly to wage a "" cold war "" even though "" sometimes it gets hot and other times it cools off . "" Governor Dewey told the delegates they were giving a wonderful demonstration of the ability of men and women to represent the best in their communities from all over the world and to get together to work for the common good . He drew applause with the remark that the delegates from twentysix nations might "" fight over a resolution "" but when they adopted it there would "" be no vetoes . "" The thirty-second annual convention of the Lions Clubs got under way officially in the Garden at 9 A. M. with a concert by high school bands from Sebring , Fla. , and , Pa . An unofficial program of social events had been  Memphis , Tenn. , past international president , called the assembly to order , International President Eugene S. Briggs , of Enid , Okla. , was escorted to the platform , and the invocation was made by the Most Rev. Stephen J. Donahue , Roman , Catholic Archbishop of the New York Archdiocese . Gimbel Welcomes Delegates The delegates were welcomed to this city  --  chosen for two successive Lions conventions ? by Bernard F. Gimbel , chairman of the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau . Admiral Blandy , who had commanded the joint task force at the Bikini atom bomb tests , told the convention that the time to organize civilian as well as military defenses against atom bombing was "" now and in the years immediately ahead , before we are actually liable to atomic attack . ""","He expressed the belief , however , that the atom bomb would not destory civilization nor would it be "" the absolute weapon of decision "" in a ' war . He said this country 's possession of the bomb was a major deterrent to war but it would not  last reason , "" said the Admiral , "" that the United States is placing its military reHance for preserving world peace lupon a team of fighting forces , comprising the Army , the Air Force , and the Navy . "" In a dramatic finale to the morning session , the flags of the countries in the Lions family were carried to the platform by United States Marines in dress uniform . Each of the twenty-six colorbearers was flanked by Marines with rifles and preceded by a girl in a different national costume . Norway Leads Procession The anthem of each country was played as its colors were presented . Norway , which has had a Lions Club only since last May , led the procession . In succession came the Philippines , Bolivia , France , Chile , Switzerland , Sweden , Australia , Ecuador , Bermuda , the Netherlands West Indies , Peru , British Honduras , Venezuela , Nicaragua , Honduras , El Salvador , Guatemala , Colombia , Costa Rica , Panama , Cuba , China , Mexico , Canada and the United States . When  was played , ' the large delegation from Canada sang . Then the entire crowd sang the "" Star Spangled Banner . "" Melvin Jones of Chicago , inter- , national secretary general , reported at the afternoon session that there were 381,426 members in 7,427 clubs as of June 30 . During the fiscal year that ended on that date , 757 new clubs had been formed , 638 of them in this country .","Bolivia , France and the Philippines , in addition to Norway , joined the organization 's family within the last year . There were concerts by bands , glee clubs and choirs from many parts of the country spaced through both sessions . The music was ' not limited to the Garden and the parade . A blue and gold jacketed band of Alabama Lions serenaded lobby crowds in the Commodore Hotel , convention staff headquarters , and music emanated from other hotels housing state delegations .","After the parade last night , the Canadian contingent played host at a concert in the Garden . The forty-girl Leslie Bell Choir ? of Toronto and the  came here in two airplanes to last night 's show , at which Guy Lombardo 's band also played .","The girl choristers and pipers were met at LaGuardia Airport , where the kilted bagpipers put on an impromptu concert , by Walter C. Fisher , international first vice president , who will be elected Thursday as the new international president . Earlier the Canadian delegation chose 17-year-old Joan Lennox of Clarkson , Ont. , as "" Queen of Canada . "" Miss Lennox will compete today with Janice Harvell , "" Queers of the United States , "" and the "" Queens "" of Cuba , Mexico , Peru and Colombia for the title of "" Queen of the Lions . "" The winner will be crowned tonight in the Garda/I .

And in the economic sphere , while other countries are not only talking but actually taking restrictive measures to deal with an abnormal situation , one sees little evidence that Germans are doing the same . This is particularly illustrated in the case of the coal shortage . The federal government and spokesmen for public and private undertakings are loud in their demands for reduction of German coal export quotas under the terms of the international Ruhr agreement . But one looks in vain for strong appeals in the press or over the radio or stronger action for local economies in the use of coal . There are no electricity cuts here and the amazing amount of electric power is used in the lighting of towns and shops in this pre-Christmas season must use up a large amount",empty,empty,1950

It is probably moral rather than economic factors that are chiefly responsible for this development . European governments are awfully tired of feeling dependent on the United States , of having to justify to their people various actions that acceptance of this aid entails and of going through the agony of Congressional hearings in which their deeds and misdeeds are aired by all and sundry who care to testify . Reports from most European countries indicate that these sentiments now far outweigh those that undoubtedly prevailed in many official circles for several years after the war that tended to look on American aid as an easy solution of vexing problems , United States economic aid is not an easy solution any more . In fact , it is coming to be realized that it is not a solution at all for Europe 's present day problems  large scale may aggravate these problems . Of course , circumstances might change , but the economics of the situation tend to reinforce Europeans ' growing desire to have economic aid end for other reasons , not least the possibility that its end might lead to some reduction of the United States ' huge bureauc-I racy in Europe which , from a pay chological viewpoint at any rate , ' has clearly outlived its time . It is not that Europe is in a position to finance all the imports it needs nor that American assistance of all kinds is no longer needed . Military aid and aid in bearing the burden of military operations against communism in other parts of the world must remain , responsible Europeans believe , if a disastrous collapse of the whole western community is to be avoided . It is large grants to governments financed by annual appropriations and allocated on the basis of bilateral negotiations that are becoming obsolete . Whether by accident or as a result of superior wisdom , originators of the Marshall Plan hit it just about right when they fixed  States could appropriately assist European countries in overcoming deficiencies in their own capacity to finance investment programs . It was necessary right after the war ; it has become both unnecessary and dangerous , observers here feel , to have the economic development of important countries like France and Britain proceed any further on the basis of the investment capital that is not their own . Stronger Disciplines Needed In the period when any increase in output of any important industrial or agricultural commodity was desirable and right from the viewpoint of Europe 's economy , justification of a project to a committee or a branch of the United States administration was perhaps a sufficient discipline . In the period when the problem is one of getting rid of economic dead wood and singling out healthy from unhealthy branches of economic activity stronger disciplines are necessary . With the exception of France and Norway , every country in Western Europe has now recognized this fact by seeking to subject important sectors of the economy once more to the rigorous disciplittd-of the capital market . Continued economic aid front abroad only makes  that industry the possibility of getting financed out of resources injected into the economy from outside . Europeans look to an increase in United States expenditures abroad and a more realistic United States import policy to keep the flow of dollars into world economy at a reasonably satisfactory level . If nonmilitary assistance remains in the picture after this year , they want it to be channeled through international or supranational agencies and to be directed to general rather than specific objectives ? building up monetary reserves rather than financing power dams . The spectacle of a French Government unable to make up its budget without knowing what American aid will be has made many Europeans feel that time has come to end this kind of thing even if the first shock of cutting the pipeline should be unpleasant .

What is the realistic appraisal of the devastation an undeclared enemy atomic-hydrogen attack could wreak upon the United States and what more should be done to avert it ? Is the Pentagon right relying so heavily upon our military ability to counterattack atomically as a deterrent to aggression ?

The regular appropriation bills were out of the way by the beginning of the new fiscal year , which , in view of the history of the last few Congresses , is itself no mean achievement . Now the remaining weeks of the session afford an opportunity for this Eighty-third Congress to end its labors with a sense of accomplishment if not in a blaze of glory . The record of the present Congress is the record on which the Eisenhower Administration has said the Republicans must stand or fall in the November elections . That record must be judged against the program of the Administration , and viewed in this light it is a mixed record thus far . The President has obtained and is likely to obtain a good deal less than lie asked for , which is certainly no novel experience for Presidents ; but he has also obtained or seems  a few weeks ago . Still , with more adept and more aggressive leadership on his own part and that of his party leaders he would probably have come much closer to the bullseye than is now possible . The principal items of the President 's program that have actually become law are the St. Lawrence Seaway , the Korean defense pact , federal aid to highways , continuation of certain excise taxes ( though modified by an unwanted reduction in others ) and extension of the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act ( though in much simpler and more abbreviated form than originally proposed ? but not fought for ? by the Administration ) . The principal items that have been specifically rejected are revision of the Taft-Hartley Act and a constitutional amendment to lower the voting age to 18 . The record of this Congress will be written even more clearly in the legislation that is now nearing its final form . This includes the highly controversial bills on tax revision , housing and farm policy . The first of these is now in conference , with a major Administration provision  dispute . The housing bill was sent to conference almost three weeks ago , where it still rests with the Administration proposal for 35,000 new public housing units a yiar hanging in the balance against the House preference for none at all . In the debate over the crucially imZ , portant farm issue in the House the Administration again felt it necessary to compromise , but it did manage to retain the principle of flexible *port prices . It remains to be seen what the outcome will be in the Senate . Two other important issues are also nearing completion but are not likely to run into much controversy now . They are extension of Social Security coverage , which has already sailed through the House ( with only two Republicans opposed  --  shades of the Thirties ! ) and the foreign-aid bill , which has also passed the House by a heavy majority . Despite the recent threats of the so-called majority leader , it is difficult to believe that the Senate would now cripple the foreign-aid bill with restrictive amendments designed to tie the hands of the President  that ought to be en- acted at this session , Hawaiian and Alaskan statehood is the outstanding example . Revision of the Atomic Energy Act is desirable , but it is doubtful that the proposed relaxation of regulations for exchange of atomic information will be approved . The effort to smooth the way toward private commercial development of atomic power has a better chance . Various anti-subversive bills are under consideration , including some of extremely doubtful value . It is important that each of these bills be given careful study and that none of them be rushed through in the closing days of the session without adequate consideration or without debate . It simply will not do for Congress blindly to pass any legislation so long as it is labeled "" anti-Communist "" ; and the action of the House in insisting  --  over the Attorney General 's protest ? on judicial safeguards for the wire-tapping bill it passed in April is a hopeful omen that Congress will not be stampeded out of a careful consideration of civil rights . And as long as the session lasts there will be  adopt general and uniform rules of procedure for the conduct of its own committees . If the session that is now drawing to an end has proved nothing else , it has demonstrated that each house of Congress has a responsibility for its committees , a responsibility that can be neither hidden nor evaded in the coming elections .

His wife and brother , Dr. Milton S. Eisenhower , watched as the patient slowly and painfully , . made his way across the room , aided by M/Sgt . J. W. Teaney and Sgt. 1/c . V. J. Jacavone . The sergeants helped the  a hassock . The President , sat there about ten minutes , and , as the doctors urged , engaged in deep breathing exercises designed to help // clear his lungs . Then , with the corpsmen at his elbows again , he walked back to his bed . The doctors proposed another walk in midafternoon , but the President demurred , according to Mr. Hagerty . The physicians did not press the point . Another factor causing the President discomfort isor that he still has a rubber tube running through his nostrils and down into his stomach to remove gas and waste . This is connected to a small suction machine . It was disconnected from the machine while the President took his walk . He still is being fed intravenously , and at night has been administered small doses of Demerol to help him sleep . Antibiotics also are being administered to guard against the danger of infection in the area where the operation was performed . About ten inches of the small intestine became inflamed and obstructed , and the operation bypassed this diseased area . It created  damaged tissue was not removed from the President 's abdomen . Mrs. Eisenhower at Bedside Mrs. Eisenhower made several trips to her husband 's bedside during the day , as did his brother .","Dr. Eisenhower later left for University Park , Pa. , where he is president of the Pennsylvania State University . The President 's son , Maj. John S. Eisenhower , and daughter-inlaw , Barbara , came in briefly in mid-afternoon . This was their ninth wedding anniversary . Other than these family members and medical personnel , the only other visitors were Sherman Adams , the Assistant to the President , and Mr. Hagerty . Each remained only a few minutes . Mr. Hagerty said the doctors thought General Eisenhower might be able to transact a little more Government business tomorrow and that a staff office would be opened in the ward near his Executive suite . If anything urgent were to arise tonight , Mr. Hagerty said , it would be taken to the President at once . Mr. Adams and Mr. Hagerty began this morning to consider what to do about some of the appointments  decided to postpone until later in the week a conference at the White House with bipartisan leaders of the Senate to discuss restoration of fund cuts made in the foreign-aid bill by the House of Representatives . They were uncertain who would sit in for the President as chairman of this meeting . Mr. Hagerty said they still were considering what to do about the proposed meeting of Presidents of the American Republics at Panama late in June , and a scheduled conference early in July with Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru of India . There were suggestions from Panama that the meeting of Presidents might be postponed until mid-July if this would facilitate attendance by General Eisenhower . His doctors have said he could resume a full work-load after convalescing four to six weeks .","All the medical news today was good , and the atmosphere was one of relieved tension . Condition Is ' Excellent ' The bulletins were issued by Dr. Howard McC . Snyder , the President 's physician , Maj. Gen. Leonard D. Heaton and Dr. Isidore S. Ravdin . General Heaton is commandant at Walter Reed  of Pennsylvania 's School of Medicine . The principal bulletin , given out at 1 P. M. , said : "" The President 's condition remains excellent . His pulse , blood pressure , temperature and respiration are essentially normal . The blood chemistry determinations are within normal limits . Appropriate antibiotics are being administered . He is still on intravenous feeding . "" This morning the President walked with support , in his room , from his bed to an armchair , a distance of fifteen feet . He sat in the chair with his legs supported on an ottoman . While sitting in the chair , he indulged in deep-breathing exercises . He remained in the chair for about ten minutes and then walked , with support , back to his bed . ""","Following this exercise , his pulse rose ten beats per minute and then returned to its previous rate within two minutes after he returned to bed . "" The final communiqu ? , at 5 P. M. , said that the President 's progress was "" uneventfnl , "" that he had a "" fairly  . The first bulletin , at 9 A. M. , said the President had "" spent a reasonably comfortable night , "" sleeping only at intervals . Later , in reply to questions , Mr. Hagerty said the President had been given three small doses of Demerol to help him sleep . The most important development of the day , of course , was the brief walk . Although it now is routine in most surgical cases , it caused some surprise in the news room when Mr. Hagerty announced that the President had taken a few steps . Asked why the doctors wanted the President to walk so soon , Mr. Hagerty conferred with the specialists . He came back with ' the answer that "" early ambulation "" was desirable to produce "" general body tone . "" It enhances and greatly hastens recovery , he said . He remarked that Dr. Ravdin had recalled that soldiers hospitalized and confined to their beds for as much as a week during the war had lost much of the conditioning and hardening received in seven months of basia training .",1956

S. S. R. demanded a revision of the Montreaux Convention under which Turkey was authorized by international agreement to administer and defend the Black Sea Straits , a waterway lying wholly within the confines of Turkey .<br>4.- The Soviet view was that Turkey , a hostile power , was not to be trusted to keep the Straits open to Soviet shipping even in times of peace .<br>5.- ( Under the convention , Turkey may close the Straits in time of war to enemy vessels . )<br>6.- We resisted the Soviet effort to bring a greater share of direct international control to the Straits by saying that any change in that  even risked a show of naval strength in Istanbul to back up our resistance to any Soviet-sponsored change in the status of the Straits .<br>7.- Case Reversed The Suez business is the exact reversal of the Straits case .<br>8.- Now it is the West  --  including the United States  --  which demands the internationalization of a waterway lying wholly within a sovereign state , Egypt .<br>9.- The difference is that the Suez Canal is of much greater importance to us than the Black Sea Straits , less important to the Soviet Union .<br>10.- It would seem that the only "" principle "" demonstrated here is that we distrust a waterway-owning state when that waterway is important to us ( or our allies ) and when there is uncertainty about the friendship of the sovereign state involved .<br>11.- If Egypt wishes to close the canal against Israeli shipping in time of active hostilities between the two countries , this is certainly a matter for Egyptian decision , just as Turkey could  --  and would  --  close the Black Sea Straits to the Soviet Union in event of hostilities with her northern neighbor  the Soviet Union as it is now doing indirectly on behalf of Israel ?<br>12.- It is exceedingly doubtful .<br>13.- Granted , the 1888 convention on free navigation in the Suez declares that the canal shall always he free , whether in time of peace or war , for ships and merchant vessels without distinction of flag .<br>14.- But did the Allied powers live up to that rule during World Wars I and II when they were in control of the canal ?<br>15.- It seems clear that we set aside international agreements when it suits our interests but become agitated when others do the same .<br>16.- Jeopardizing Relations ?<br>17.- As a matter of fact , it so happens that the 1888 convention was drawn up between the European powers on the one hand and the Ottoman Empire on the other , not by any independent Egyptian Government .<br>18.- Is the Government of contemporary Egypt bound by an agreement signed by an unwelcome foreign master -- -namely , the Ottoman Empire ?<br>19.- It is exceedingly doubtful .<br>20.- Another point : Is it good diplomacy to present a country with a proposal that is foredoomed to  our wish and intent to further good relations with the country involved ?<br>21.- This is precisely what we have done in the case of Egypt .<br>22.- President Nasser could not possibly accept the Western proposal , so why make it ?<br>23.- We have said time and again that we can not condone the use of force in effecting international changes , yet we allow ourselves to be identified with the naked threat of force against Egypt by Britain and France .<br>24.- We thereby help place President Nasser in the position of negotiating almost directly under French and British guns .<br>25.- If a Communist state pulled this sort of maneuver , we would scream bloody murder and perhaps raise a U. N. police force to protect the threatened state .<br>26.- Sovereignty Affirmed And , in so far as the act of nationalizing the canal is concerned , the United States has repeatedly affirmed the principle that a sovereign government has the right to expropriate foreign-owned property within its jurisdiction so long as just , rapid and effective compensation is paid .<br>27.- There seems to be no question that Egypt is quite willing  of the United States Congress that foreign peoples should conclude that our economic assistance is available only when there exists a real and pressing Communist threat against them ?<br>28.- If this be so , one can predict that the Communist threat will become very much greater than it is .<br>29.- Yet our offer and withdrawal of assistance for construction of the Aswan Dam in Egypt certainly leads one to that conclusion .<br>30.- The unchallenged record is that we withdrew the offer only when we found that the Russians were not and would not make a similar offer .<br>31.- What a negative and unappealing motive for economic assistance .<br>32.- The United States , as great and as powerful as it is , can not forever fight against the rising tide in Asia and Africa .<br>33.- If we have to desert our European allies so as not to be swept out to sea in a mighty undertow , desert them we must .<br>34.- The interests of the United States and of justice demand that we do so .<br>35.- RICHARD D.

Ronan of your service in the United Kingdom reports what Emil Rieve , chairman of the executive council of the Textile Workers Union and a vice president of the new labor merger in the United States , told the eighty-eighth annual conference of the British Trades Union Congress .<br>39.- Mr. Rieve accused employers in the United States of trying to keep for themselves , in the form of higher profits , all the benefits of automation .<br>40.- While of course there are variations wherever human nature is concerned , it is not true that most employers are trying to keep for themselves the benefits of automation .<br>41.- The vast majority of business men on this continent try constantly to cut costs and so to lower prices , but the main obstacle is that wage advances far exceed increased productivity , Hence prices are up by the difference .<br>42.- Mr. Rieve would do well to read Russell Davenport 's "" The Dignity of Man , "" in which is described the economic revolution that has been taking place in North America  of the traditional capitalist system into "" consumer-capitalism .

It also underscores the inept and shortsighted manner in which United States foreign policy is being dictated by Secretary of State Dulles . In 1946 the U. S. S. R. demanded a revision of the Montreaux Convention under which Turkey was authorized by international agreement to administer and defend the Black Sea Straits , a waterway lying wholly within the confines of Turkey . The Soviet view was that Turkey , a hostile power , was not to be trusted to keep the Straits open to Soviet shipping even in times of peace . ( Under the convention , Turkey may close the Straits in time of war to enemy vessels . ) We resisted the Soviet effort to bring a greater share of direct international control to the Straits by saying that any change in that  even risked a show of naval strength in Istanbul to back up our resistance to any Soviet-sponsored change in the status of the Straits . Case Reversed The Suez business is the exact reversal of the Straits case . Now it is the West  --  including the United States  --  which demands the internationalization of a waterway lying wholly within a sovereign state , Egypt . The difference is that the Suez Canal is of much greater importance to us than the Black Sea Straits , less important to the Soviet Union . It would seem that the only "" principle "" demonstrated here is that we distrust a waterway-owning state when that waterway is important to us ( or our allies ) and when there is uncertainty about the friendship of the sovereign state involved . If Egypt wishes to close the canal against Israeli shipping in time of active hostilities between the two countries , this is certainly a matter for Egyptian decision , just as Turkey could  --  and would  --  close the Black Sea Straits to the Soviet Union in event of hostilities with her northern neighbor  the Soviet Union as it is now doing indirectly on behalf of Israel ? It is exceedingly doubtful . Granted , the 1888 convention on free navigation in the Suez declares that the canal shall always he free , whether in time of peace or war , for ships and merchant vessels without distinction of flag . But did the Allied powers live up to that rule during World Wars I and II when they were in control of the canal ? It seems clear that we set aside international agreements when it suits our interests but become agitated when others do the same . Jeopardizing Relations ? As a matter of fact , it so happens that the 1888 convention was drawn up between the European powers on the one hand and the Ottoman Empire on the other , not by any independent Egyptian Government . Is the Government of contemporary Egypt bound by an agreement signed by an unwelcome foreign master -- -namely , the Ottoman Empire ? It is exceedingly doubtful . Another point : Is it good diplomacy to present a country with a proposal that is foredoomed to  our wish and intent to further good relations with the country involved ? This is precisely what we have done in the case of Egypt . President Nasser could not possibly accept the Western proposal , so why make it ? We have said time and again that we can not condone the use of force in effecting international changes , yet we allow ourselves to be identified with the naked threat of force against Egypt by Britain and France . We thereby help place President Nasser in the position of negotiating almost directly under French and British guns . If a Communist state pulled this sort of maneuver , we would scream bloody murder and perhaps raise a U. N. police force to protect the threatened state . Sovereignty Affirmed And , in so far as the act of nationalizing the canal is concerned , the United States has repeatedly affirmed the principle that a sovereign government has the right to expropriate foreign-owned property within its jurisdiction so long as just , rapid and effective compensation is paid . There seems to be no question that Egypt is quite willing  of the United States Congress that foreign peoples should conclude that our economic assistance is available only when there exists a real and pressing Communist threat against them ? If this be so , one can predict that the Communist threat will become very much greater than it is . Yet our offer and withdrawal of assistance for construction of the Aswan Dam in Egypt certainly leads one to that conclusion . The unchallenged record is that we withdrew the offer only when we found that the Russians were not and would not make a similar offer . What a negative and unappealing motive for economic assistance . The United States , as great and as powerful as it is , can not forever fight against the rising tide in Asia and Africa . If we have to desert our European allies so as not to be swept out to sea in a mighty undertow , desert them we must . The interests of the United States and of justice demand that we do so . RICHARD D. ROBINSON . Weston , Mass. , Sept. 8 , 1956 . Benefiting by  TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Thomas P. Ronan of your service in the United Kingdom reports what Emil Rieve , chairman of the executive council of the Textile Workers Union and a vice president of the new labor merger in the United States , told the eighty-eighth annual conference of the British Trades Union Congress . Mr. Rieve accused employers in the United States of trying to keep for themselves , in the form of higher profits , all the benefits of automation . While of course there are variations wherever human nature is concerned , it is not true that most employers are trying to keep for themselves the benefits of automation . The vast majority of business men on this continent try constantly to cut costs and so to lower prices , but the main obstacle is that wage advances far exceed increased productivity , Hence prices are up by the difference . Mr. Rieve would do well to read Russell Davenport 's "" The Dignity of Man , "" in which is described the economic revolution that has been taking place in North America  of the traditional capitalist system into "" consumer-capitalism . "" Claims on Business In the old capitalism capital was an end in itself ; the system existed and was operated for the owners , the capitalists . The revolution has changed things so that the capitalist becomes one of a group of five  --  the owner , the management , the worker , the general public and the consumer . Each has different but rightful claims upon any business , especially the big ones . The result is a dispersal of economic power on a truly democratic scale and a redefinition of the capitalist system in such a way as to admit the economic rights of the average citizen , who is increasingly a stockholder . Among the five parties concerned the balance is held by the consumer , who has the final word . The capitalist has not been replaced by the worker , as in a Communist proletarian society , or by a political bureaucracy , as in a Socialist society , or by management . The capitalist is controlled by the consumer . Each individual consumer stands at  primarily to serve him . It is he who defines the purpose of the new capitalism . The danger to the new structure of balanced capitalism today is not from ownership or management or workers ; the danger is from syndicalist trade-union leaders attempting to dominate not only industry but also the whole of society by deliberately misrepresenting the attitude and wishes of workers . It is increasingly urgent to secure real freedom for individual workers releasing them from the elaborate structure of compulsion that now holds them in abject servitude to trade-union bosses .

This is opposed by the Administration . Although the bill faces inaction in the House , the aim of dramatizing the dispute as a party issue has been accomplished . The Democrats also have staged demonstrations against the Administration 's farm policies , notably . in House rejection of its soil bank program . The House subsequently bowed to the Senate 's insistence on keeping the bank in business for another year . Under the soil bank , farmers are paid to remove surpluscrop land from production . The House gesture showed that the once-powerful coalition of Democrats  into warring Democratic and Republican camps . Since regional farmer interests also are at stake , however , it is uncertain which party stands to gain or lose more by ect at Niagara Falls . The House is expected to pass it in the meantime . CA compromise bill by Senator John F. Kennedy , Democrat of Massachusetts , to ease restrictions on the admission of refugees and regular immigrants . 11A bill to curtail access by defendants in criminal cases to confidential records of the Federal Bureau of Investigation . This measure stemmed from recent Supreme Court decisions granting a defendant access to statements taken by the F. B. I. from witnesses in the case . Natural Gas Bill Pending A bill to ease Federal . control of natural gas prices charged by producers is awaiting House action , but is not scheduled for Senate consideration until next year . It is supported by President Eisenhower . The Administration , backed by Republican legislators , is ' fighting to continue its policy of relying primarily on private industry to develop atomic power . Democrats are preparing to renew their challenge  produce results . Senate Still to Act The atomic power bill is among a number of measures that the Senate must dispose of before adjournment , once the civil rights battle has ended . ? Of other bills on the agenda , several may be sandwiched between the current preliminary , and the main round of the civil rights struggle . The rest will be considered . in the adjournment rush after disposal of the civil ' rights issue . The Senate bills include : ( The final version of the Mu- , tual Security authorization . The Senate has passed the bill , but must approve a compromise to be worked out by Senate-House conferees after House action .

Instead , they are now giving primary consideration in informal consultations to relatively minor reductions in excise ( sales ) taxes on autoniobiles and a few other goods and services . These Democratic strategists hold that general tax relief can not be justified as an antirecession weapon unless the economy should start declining at a much sharper rate than that of the last few months . And they believe the slump is unlikely to get much worse before Congress adjourns some time in July or August . Truce in Effect A tax-cutting truce is now in effect between Robert B. Anderson , Secretary of the Treasury , and the chief Democratic leaders of the House and Senate , Speaker Sam Rayburn and Senator Lyndon B. Johnson , both of Texas . Under a gentlemen 's agreement reached in mid-March , neither side will put forward a tax relief plan without consulting the other . As leader of the House , where revenue legislation originates  close the door on any general tax cut this session .","He would like thereby to put a quick end to the present uncertainty , which has been blamed for much of the widespread buyers ' ? resistance that is contributing to the business slump . Anderson Pledge Asked The Speaker has told colleagues that he would be willing to announce now his opposition to a general tax cut this session if Secretary Anderson would promise not to recommend one on behalf of the Administration . It is doubtful , however , whether Mr. Anderson would give such a pledge . The Administration , by all signs , does not want to foreclose all possibility of wide tax relief as a last resort weapon against a worsening recession . The apparent prospect , consequently , is for continuation of the truce at least until late May or early June and perhaps until Congress adjourns . In the immediate background of this situation is a growing feeling , reinforced by legislators ' consultations with constituents during the Easter recess , that there is no strong grass roots demand for general tax relief  over the fact that a tax cut would add to the already large prospective Federal deficit and increase the national debt . The possibility that tax reduction would set off another inflationary spiral is anther consideration very muchln the minds of legislators . Behind all this is a belief , which has gained widespread acceptance in the last decade , that tax reduction has lost virtually all its traditional political appeal . The mass of the voters now pay the bulk of their taxes as weekly deductions from their wages and are not so much aware of the heavy burden as they used to be . By and large . they are not vitally concerned over a possible increase of a mere $2 or $3 in weekly takehome pay that even a big tax cut would provide .",Truman Victory Cited Those sharing the belief that tax reduction is no longer necessarily good politics point to recent history . Harry S. Truman won a surprising Presidential victory and the Democrats regained control of Congress in 1948 . A major campaign issue was the enactment by the preceding Republican ( Eightieth )  .,"Among the Republicans losing their Congressional seats that year was Representative Harold Knutson of Minnesota , Ways and Means Committee chairman and sponsor of the tax relief bill . In the 1954 Congressional ' campaign , Republicans claimed credit for $7,400,000,000 of tax reductions . Yet they again lost control of Congress after two years in power . The excise tax reductions now under consideration would be provided as amendments to what ordinarily is a routine bill to postpone for another year automatic tax reductions scheduled for June 30 .","Present law calls for the expiration then of rate increases , imposed to finance the Korean war , on corporation income and on automobiles , cigarettes and liquor . Congress Must Act Unless Congress acts , the corporation tax will drop from 52 per cent of earnings to 47 per cent . Simultaneous reductions would occur as follows : cigarettes , from 8 cents a pack to 7 cents ; liquor , from $10.50 to $9 a gallon ; beer , from $9 to $8 a barrel , and automobiles , from 10 per cent to 7 per cent of  to extend all these rates for another year except the one on automobiles : The automobile levy would be allowed to drop to 7 per cent or perhaps be fixed at 5 per cent . Halving the present rate would mean a saving of about $150 on a $3,000 car if the cut were passed along to the consumer , as manufacturers and dealers have promised . The bill probably would also provide for some reduction in the 3 per cent tax on transportation of property and in the 10 per cent levy on transportation of persons . Consideration also is being given to a cut in the 10 per cent tax on local telephone service .",empty,1958

"" Mr. Khrushchev advanced his proposal Sunday in response to a suggestion by the President and Prime Minister Macmillan that the Geneva conference on disarmament open on March 14 at the foreign ministers level . Danger of Setback Cited In a letter sent to Moscow last night and made public by the White House today , the President replied that he did not question "" the utility or perhaps even the necessity "" of a summit meeting at the proper time . But the proper time , he added , is after "" the main problems have been clarified and prop . Tess has been made . "" Until then , he said , "" intervention by heads of goverment would involve merely a general exchange of governmental positions which might set back ,  In a separate letter Prime Minister Macmillan expressed similar reservations about holding a summit conference at the start of the Geneva meeting . In Moscow , Soviet propaganda organs pressed the Western powers to agree to a summit meeting at the disarmament conference . Reply Moderate in Tone Mr. Khrushchev 's letter to the Western leaders was marked by an unwonted absence of propaganda charges , and the President 's negative reply was softly turned . But in his news conference today Mr. Kennedy made plain that any apparent easing of tensions in the last few weeks was a matter  --  as he said a week ago  --  of "" atmospherics "" and not of substance . Thus , when he was asked whether Army reservists might soon be released from active service because of easing of the Berlin crisis , he asserted : "" The crisis continues ? ? ? and the need for the reservists continues until there is an easing of the crisis or until we have been able to replace them with other men . "" Question 29 , Page 14 . The President reiterated , In  to Mr. Khrushchev . Asked for his view m "" summitry "" after a year 's experience with all kinds of diplomacy , he replied : "" My view is the same as it has been , and that is that a summit is not the place to carry on negotiations which involve details , and that a summit should be a place where perhaps agreements which have been achieved at a lower level could be finally , officially approved by the heads of government , or if there was a major crisis which threatened to involve us all in a war , there might be a need for a summit . "" Question 9 . The President 's message to Mr. Khrushchev was carefully phrased to avoid several pit1 falls He did not wish to rebuff the Soviet leader 's suggestion and so give him an opportunity to make "" peacemaker "" propaganda in nonaligned nations . On the other hand , he did not wish to commit the United States to a summit meeting unless it was warranted by real progress . "" As you have suggested , ""  between our two positions . Just one example is the Soviet unwillingness so far to accord the control organization the authority to verify during the disarmament process that agreed levels of forces and armament are not exceeded . "" When the British - United States-Soviet negotiations on a treaty to ban nuclear weapons tests were recessed in deadlock two weeks ago , the United ; States indicated that it would ' like the test question to he given early attention in the disarmament conference . The President said that any nuclear inspection system would have to extend to Communist China . Admitting the difficulties in "" attempting to bring them the Chinese Communists in , "" he said it would be useless to have an inspection system that would leave a "" large "" country free to carry on "" an intensive armament preparation .

I am always dubious about "" firsts "" but perhaps this was . The uniqueness , allegedly , was that Mexicans of sharply divided views , and Americans , publicly debated the most controversial aspects of their mutual concern . Two Environments It was a good discussion . The crux of the matter was the interplay of governmental controls and private enterprise in the two American environments .

These propositions may not be true in some areas of the country  --  for example , In some predominantly Democratic states of the South and some predominantly Republican states of the Middle West , where the spirit of the people is more conservative . But in national terms , it is difficult to argue from the record that either party can win the Presidency or even be an effective national opposition if it defies these propositions .

Individuals may ignore and even resent the success of these moderate to progressive candidates of both parties , but political parties can not .

People are not as rigid  things they support in practice , and the successful politicians of the last generation have been those who have appealed to the people 's interests and not to the people 's pretenses . The record simply does not support the notion that moving the Republican party from the center to the conservative right strengthens the Republican opposition and helps restore a balance in American political life . It does the opposite . It gives the people a clear "" choice "" all right , but a choice they are not prepared to accept . It does not balance or weaken the left but strengthens the left . It increases the noise and it envenoms the political argument , but it actually reduces the power of the Republican oppomtion . The Decisive Center Eisenhower and the British Conservatives have demonstrated that the best way to gain national power in a Western democracy is not by moving to the right and exaggerating the differences with the party on the left , but by commanding the center , accepting the best of the liberal policies , and arguing that the moderates can administer them  policy reforms which the Democrats introduced and his own party opposed in the thirties and forties , and thus managed to be the only Republican President in the last 33 years . Goldwater gave the impression that he was against these reforms and was overwhelmingly defeated . This is still the main political lesson of the postwar era . The decisive battleground of American politics lies in the center and can not be captured from either of the extremes , and any party that defies this principle does not improve its chances of national power or even effective opposition , but precisely the opposite .

Established in 1967 by the Administrator of Veterans Affairs at the request of the President , the commission was asked to study how tax dollars are being spent for the veteran and how Government responsibilities to the veteran are being met . The commission was drawn largely from state veterans ' offices and the larger and older national veterans ' groups . That it reflects the grasping philosophy of one of the most potent lobbies in the United States is not surprising . That its recommendations to the Government should be taken seriously is unthinkable . On the contrary , the report only illustrates the urgent need for an informed and responsible evaluation of veterans ' programs , for today veterans ' expenditures approach $7 billion , are the fifth largest item in the national budget , and veterans , with their families , dependents and widows , are approaching the time when they will approximate 50  the Government to deal generously with every man who has suffered a disability in service and to equalize the opportunity for every veteran with the citizen who stayed at home , there is no question . There is great question , however , over the hundreds of millions of dollars in unjustified elements of the veterans ' programs and the added billions foreshadowed by the present recommendations . ? President Eisenhower in 1956 commissioned the famous Bradley report on veterans ' affairs , which , though much of it was not acted upon , was a model of enlightened thinking , fair to the veteran and fair to the nation . Animating that report was its conviction that military service in time of war and peace is an obligation of citizenship and should not be considered inherently a basis for future Government benefits . Retrograde in its philosophy , the present commission challenges this concept and would create a permanent privileged class of veterans , a postwar mercenary class uncongenial to the national heritage . While enlightened thinking on veterans ' affairs has called for the integration of veterans ' programs  such as Medicare and Social Security , the recent Commission report opposes this position . The 1956 report also put a heavy emphasis on benefits for veterans with service-connected needs , but the present commission would extend benefits for nonservice-connected disabilities , despite the many Federally sponsored programs covering such needs . As a final effort to aggrandize and solidify the specialized status of the veteran and the concept of veteran versus citizen , the commission recommends that the Veterans Administration be given Cabinet status and that a Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs be created . Acceptance of these two recommendations would provide new pressure points for the politically powerful lobbies of the veterans ' groups and their emotion-laden , self-seeking campaigns . The nature of the report of the commission underlines the urgency of setting up a permanent Board of Review on Veterans Affairs , independent of the vested interests , to make a continuing and searching evaluation , a board responsible to the President alone and one composed of men whose first responsibility is to the broad public interest .

A year later , the peace movement has grown to include more than 1,000 organizations , and this week announced plans for more and larger demonstrations . Antiwar rallies escalate across U.S. Thousands of demonstrators in cities across the United States and abroad are preparing to take part in a new series of antiwar rallies this weekend . Following is the first of two reports offering a close look at antiwar protesters and what they stand for . The antiwar movement presses on . The enthusiastic receptions across the nation for current peace-conference prospects , for the standpoints of Sens . Eugene J. McCarthy and Robert F. Kennedy , both sharp critics of the Vietnam war , show this . But there are other indications : ? Antiwar groups are blossoming like spring flowers . There are well over 1,000 organizations protesting the war today , according to a survey by this writer  spring . Likely to give added impetus to the peace movement is disclosure this week by Lewis B. Hershey , selective-service director , of an estimate that up to 100,000 more men than originally scheduled may be drafted in the 12 months starting July 1 ? "" if the war does n't get over , "" as he put it . He said as many as 340,000 men may be called up during the next fiscal year . ? There are at least 28,000 hard-core activists within these groups . Most are members of several antiwar organizations . ? In addition , there are tens of thousands of Americans who support these groups by signing petitions , writing their congressmen , picketing , attending meetings and rallies , or working for peace candidates . ? For the most part , these persons are not hippies , perennial protesters , Communists , or even just pacifists . They are housewives , business executives , above-average students , laborers . Many of * Plpase turn to Page 12 *Wu-protest escalate ac rallies Toss U.S. // them supported or fought in World War II  frustration of not winning the war encourages their protest . ? But these thousands of new protesters ? those who have made the peace movement "" respectable "" this past year  --  object to the war for one basic reason : They totally reject the Johnson administration 's domino theory . That is , if South Vietnam falls to communism , the rest of Southeast Asia would soon collapse . They reject this theory because they doubt that the intent of the major Communist nations is "" expansion and extension of Communist domination , "" as reiterated by Secretary of State Dean Rusk during the recent Senate foreign-relations hearings . Thus , to these war protesters the United States is the aggressor in Vietnam ; the war is immoral ; the use of such weapons as napalm is therefore inhumane ; and our fighting is actually driving South Vietnamese into communism as a way out of war . Small groups forming ? Much of the protest has been found on America 's campuses . Off campus , protest centers in the major cities . But now small antiwar groups are forming  or in the South or in the conservative suburbs of large cities . ? Most Americans protesting this war appear to be well dressed , conscientious , fully convinced of the immorality of the war , and commited to the point that they risk constant and bitter verbal attack from their neighbors and fellow workers . "" We believe there is far more of a groundswell for peace than meets the eye , or is organized , or deserves the "" nik "" or "" hip "" labels . . . , "" says the Rev. Christian H.

If they did they , like like early , civil-rights leaders , might better control the entire protest and put their efforts to maximum benefit . There have been protests on the University of Iowa campus for three years , and many students express discouragement at failing to stop the Vietnam war . Even so , they continue to picket , sit in , raise thousands of dollars for bailing students out of jail , . distribute antiwar literature , and form new antiwar groups . At present in Iowa City , there are two Graft-resistance groups , a local chapter of Students for a Democratic Society , a Citizens Committee against the war , a Committee of Concerned Faculty , a Student Bail Fund , the Hawkeye Student Party ( a leftist student party which runs candidates for student offices ) , and Iowa Vets for Peace .

"" War exploitation charged Mr. Chinh continued his criticism by saying : "" Taking advantage of the war situation , a number of persons in the old exploiting classes and speculators have resumed their activities and exploited the workers under modified forms . On the other hand , the speculation rowdies have colluded with a small number of aberrant elements in state organs and enterprises to steal raw material , material supplies , and goods of the state , . . thus , to a certain extent , upsetting the market . "" Concerning the countryside , Mr. Chinh urged that the collectivization of farmlands be stepped up as a means of fighting "" against corruption , waste , and officialdom . We must prevent all schemes for changing land and property of collective ownership into  . "" Continued ' education ' urged "" As for the bourgeois individuals who have been admitted to joint state-private enterprises , "" he said , "" we must continue to educate them so as to raise their political and ideological level . . . in order that they may have conditions for continued reform and become real workers of a socialist country . "" As for those who steal the ' property of the state or the community or those who speculate on and monopolize the market , we must endeavor to educate them and , in serious cases , punish them . "" Informed sources here assume that many of the economic shortcomings referred to by Mr. Chinh resulted from the decentralization and dislocations caused by the American bombing of North Vietnam . This has apparently enabled lower-level Communist cadre to engage more freely in corrupt practices , especially selling on the black market rice gathered from the collective farms . These sources hold that as the supply and distribution system encountered more difficulties , collective-farm members devoted an increasing amount of time to cultivating their own private plots  enterprise , opposed by the Communist regime , began to develop , mostly in the form of small tradesmen , craftsmen , and others who operated outside of collectives . Capitalism ' at issue in north Mr. Chinh , who advocated "" revolutionary violence "" in his speech for both North and South Vietnam , warned that in the north , "" the struggle between the socialist path and the capitalist path is still going on to definitely determine who will defeat whom .","This is a protracted , hard , and complicated struggle . . . "" This correspondent has also interviewed defectors from the North Vietnamese Army , who report that the black-market price of rice was four times higher than the government-controlled price when they left the north last year . Mr. Chinh is considered by some exports to form , or lead , the "" hard line "" or "" pro-Peking "" faction in North Vietnam 's Politburo . He was a prime mover behind North Vietnam 's ruthless and bloody campaign for farm collectivization in 1956 , but when the program failed , he was temporarily  spot in Hanoi 's Politburo , however .",empty,empty,empty,1968

Restriction on Funds The funds could be released ' only if the President and Congress decided jointly that deployment of the MIRV warheads was necessary to guarantee the retaliatory capability of the United States . The arms limitation talks reopened in Helsinki on July 8 . Senator Humphrey also an . ' pounced that he would introduce a sense-of-the-Senate resolution calling upon the President to propose that the United States and the Soviet  defensive nuclear weapons while the arms talks were being held . A similar resolution was approved by the Senate two years agog This time there is an important political difference : the initiative is coming not from Republicans ? as was the case with the 1969 resolution originally sponsored by Senator Edward W. Brooke of Massachusetts ? but from prominent , Democrats who are contending for the Presidential nomination . In some ways , Senator Humphrey stole the march on Senator Muskie , who had been trying to develop a case for a moratorium on the deployment ' of MIRV 's and antiballistic missile ; or ABM , systems in his Subcommittee hearings . As Senator Humphrey was fnaking his proposal for a freeze , on . nuclear weapons , Senator Muskie broke in to observe that it was "" comparable "" to the suggestion he had made more than , a year ago for , a moratorium that would be renewed every six months , depending upon whether the Soviet observed it , Senator Humphrey at first described the Muskie approach as "" cautious "" but later , in a  the idea of a six-month renewal period . The two Democrats eventually joined in endorsing the proposal for a moratorium and , in so doing , appeared to be staking out a Democratic alternative to the Administration 's negotiating position at the arms talks . At one point Senator Humphrey observed that he was not being "" critical "" of the President but rather was trying to "" supplement "" and "" complement "" his efforts to reach an agreement on the limitation of strategic arms . The two Democrats are also challenging the Administration argument emphasized by Deputy Defense Secretary David Packard before the subcommittee yesterday  --  that the United States must proceed with development of MIRV 's and the Safeguard . ABM system as "" bargaining chips "" in the negotiations with the Soviet Union . Highly Tenuous ' Reason Senator Humphrey said that Administration officials "" must remember when they ; talk of a tough negotiating position , they are going to get a tough response . ' Noting that the original purpose of the MIRV 's was to penetrate a Soviet ABM defense , he contended that  "" highly tenuous "" now that the United States and the Soviet Union had agreed to seek a limitation on ABM systems . If an ABM agreement was reached , he said , the deployment of MIRV 's would be wasteful and would jeopardize any possibility or further arms agreement on offensive weapons . In proposing a freeze on Weapons deployment , he said : "" Our negotiators and Soviet negotiators can not arrive at agreements on shifting sands . they need a temporary halt or hold on offensive weapons to provide a solid foundation and climate to shape their proposals .

It is a result more of anticipated conflicts between the two countries than of any specific problem that has developed so far .,"But even this anticipation is being taken seriously by both sides . In background conversations in the last two weeks , senior officials in Washington and Jerusalem expressed concern that a serious collision of interests might emerge between the United States and Israel when hard bargaining over Sinai gets under way with Egypt . Preliminary contacts toward a new Sinai agreement have already begun through Secretary of State Kissinger . Detailed negotiations are expected to start next month or in February . An initial Sinai agreement was reached between Israel and Egypt early this year and resulted in a disengagement of forces on the Suez front . A second-stage agreement is under consideration now . Reduced to  officials is as follows : Th6 United States , concerned about the possibility of renewed fighting in the Middle East , the imposition of another oil embargo and resulting economic chaos , is expected to press Israel to agree to significant territorial and political concessions .

Finally , according to officials here , Mr. Ford stressed that in the American view , political movement was crucial to peace in the Middle East and Israel would have to help achieve it . Israel , by contrast , is said to feel that major concessions to Egypt at this point would serve only to whet the Arab appetite for further Israeli withdrawals and hasten war rather than  buy time in the upcoming negotiations . Premier Yitzhak Rabin has conceded this publicly , explaining that Israel "" needs time to recuperate . "" Specifically , the Israelis want time to complete rebuilding and retraining their army , which suffered major losses in equipment and manpower in the war with the Arabs last year . The first and most crucial phase of this process is expected to end by April , when emergency arms deliveries from the United States will be completed .","In the longer term , Israel is eager to buy time until the world energy situation stabilizes and oil becomes less use- , ful as a weapon for the Arab states . In addition , the Israelis are aware that the United States will hold a Presidential election in 1976 , and that at such times their political strength In Washington is usually enhanced . For all these reasons , the Israeli strategy is to use the negotiations to buy breathing space . They are prepared to make concessions to achieve this , but it Is doubtful that the concessions they have in mind would be adequate  the negotiations offered an Israeli withdrawal of up to 30 miles from the present ceasefire line , except from the strategically important Mitla and Gidi Passes and the captured Egyptian oil wells at Abu Rudeis .","Israel asked for a variety of political concessions from Egypt in exchange , including pledges to end the economic and political boycott of Israel and a longterm undertaking to stay out of any war started by another state in the area .
